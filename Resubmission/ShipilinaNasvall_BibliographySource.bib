@article{menchetti_spatio-temporal_2019,
	Abstract = {Modelling ecological niches of migratory animals requires incorporating a temporal dimension, in addition to space. Here, we introduce an approach to model multigenerational migratory insects using time-partitioned environmental variables (by months and years) and time- and behaviour-partitioned records (breeding records to model reproductive habitat). We apply this methodology to modelling the Palearctic-African migratory cycle of the Painted Lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui), based on data encompassing 36 years (646 breeding sites from 30 countries). Each breeding record is linked to a particular time (month and year), and the associated values of the bioclimatic variables are used for an ensemble modelling strategy, to finally obtain monthly projections. The results show obligated movements, mostly latitudinal, for the species' successive generations across the overall range, and only scattered locations show high probabilities of reproduction year-round. The southernmost reproductive areas estimated for the Palearctic-African migratory pool reach equatorial latitudes from December to February. We thus propose a potential distribution for the winter `missing generations' that would expand the
              V. cardui
              migration cycle to encompass about 15 000 km in latitude, from northernmost Europe to equatorial Africa. In summer, Europe represents the major temporary resource for
              V. cardui
              , while January and February show the lowest overall suitability values, and they are potentially the most vulnerable period for the species to suffer yearly bottlenecks. In summary, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed niche modelling strategy to investigate migratory movements of insects.},

@article{aholaGlanvilleFritillaryGenome2014,
	Abstract = {Previous studies have reported that chromosome synteny in Lepidoptera has been well conserved, yet the number of haploid chromosomes varies widely from 5 to 223. Here we report the genome (393\,Mb) of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia; Nymphalidae), a widely recognized model species in metapopulation biology and eco-evolutionary research, which has the putative ancestral karyotype of n=31. Using a phylogenetic analyses of Nymphalidae and of other Lepidoptera, combined with orthologue-level comparisons of chromosomes, we conclude that the ancestral lepidopteran karyotype has been n=31 for at least 140\,My. We show that fusion chromosomes have retained the ancestral chromosome segments and very few rearrangements have occurred across the fusion sites. The same, shortest ancestral chromosomes have independently participated in fusion events in species with smaller karyotypes. The short chromosomes have higher rearrangement rate than long ones. These characteristics highlight distinctive features of the evolutionary dynamics of butterflies and moths.},

@article{alexaImprovedScoringFunctional2006,
	Abstract = {Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.Availability: topgo.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.deContact:alexa@mpi-sb.mpg.deSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{amendQuantifyingMicrobialCommunities2010,
	Abstract = {Pyrosequencing technologies have revolutionized how we describe and compare complex microbial communities. In 454 pyrosequencing data sets, the abundance of reads pertaining to taxa or phylotypes is commonly interpreted as a measure of genic or taxon abundance, useful for quantitative comparisons of community similarity. Potentially systematic biases inherent in sample processing, amplification and sequencing, however, may alter read abundance and reduce the utility of quantitative metrics. Here, we examine the relationship between read abundance and biological abundance in a sample of house dust spiked with known quantities and identities of fungi along a dilution gradient. Our results show one order of magnitude differences in read abundance among species. Precision of quantification within species along the dilution gradient varied from R2 of 0.96--0.54. Read-quality based processing stringency profoundly affected the abundance of one species containing long homopolymers in a read orientation-biased manner. Order-level composition of background environmental fungal communities determined from pyrosequencing data was comparable with that derived from cloning and Sanger sequencing and was not biased by read orientation. We conclude that read abundance is approximately quantitative within species, but betweenspecies comparisons can be biased by innate sequence structure. Our results showed a trade off between sequence quality stringency and quantification. Careful consideration of sequence processing methods and community analyses are warranted when testing hypotheses using read abundance data.},

@article{anthonyGABAReceptorMolecules1993,
	Abstract = {Receptors for 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been identified in both central and peripheral nervous systems of several invertebrate phyla. To date, much of the information derived from physiological and biochemical studies on insect GABA receptors relates to GABA-gated chloride channels that show some similarities with vertebrate GABAA receptors. Like their vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) counterparts, agonist activation of such insect GABA receptors leads to a rapid, picrotoxin-sensitive increase in chloride ion conductance across the cell membrane. In insects, responses to GABA can be modulated by certain benzodiazepines and barbiturates. However, recent studies have detected a number of striking pharmacological differences between GABA-gated chloride channels of insects and vertebrates. Receptor binding, electrophysiological and 36Cl- flux assays have indicated that many insect receptors of this type are insensitive to the vertebrate GABAA antagonists bicuculline and pitrazepin. Benzodiazepine binding sites coupled to insect GABA receptors display a pharmacological profile distinct from that of corresponding sites in vertebrate CNS. Receptor binding studies have also demonstrated differences between convulsant binding sites of insect and vertebrate receptors. Insect GABA receptor molecules are important target sites for several chemically-distinct classes of insecticidally-active molecules. By characterizing these pharmacological properties in detail, it may prove possible to exploit differences between vertebrate and insect GABA receptors in the rational design of novel, more selective pest control agents. The recent application of the powerful techniques of molecular biology has revealed a diversity of vertebrate GABAA receptor subunits and their respective isoforms that can assemble in vivo to form a multiplicity of receptor subtypes. Molecular cloning of insect GABA receptor subunits will not only enhance our understanding of invertebrate neurotransmitter receptor diversity but will also permit the precise identification of the sites of action of pest control agents.},

@article{apuliInferringGenomicLandscape2020,
	Abstract = {The rate of meiotic recombination is one of the central factors determining genome-wide levels of linkage disequilibrium which has important consequences for the efficiency of natural selection and for the dissection of quantitative traits. Here we present a new, high-resolution linkage map for Populus tremula that we use to anchor approximately two thirds of the P. tremula draft genome assembly on to the expected 19 chromosomes, providing us with the first chromosome-scale assembly for P. tremula (Table 2). We then use this resource to estimate variation in recombination rates across the P. tremula genome and compare these results to recombination rates based on linkage disequilibrium in a large number of unrelated individuals. We also assess how variation in recombination rates is associated with a number of genomic features, such as gene density, repeat density and methylation levels. We find that recombination rates obtained from the two methods largely agree, although the LD-based method identifies a number of genomic regions with very high recombination rates that the map-based method fails to detect. Linkage map and LD-based estimates of recombination rates are positively correlated and show similar correlations with other genomic features, showing that both methods can accurately infer recombination rate variation across the genome. Recombination rates are positively correlated with gene density and negatively correlated with repeat density and methylation levels, suggesting that recombination is largely directed toward gene regions in P. tremula.},

	Abstract = {The vitellogenin gene promoter (VgP) is an essential cis-regulatory element that plays a significant role in transcription of the vitellogenin (Vg) gene, leading to the production of yolk protein in insects, including lepidopterans. However, the function of VgP is still not clear in Plutella xylostella. Here, we cloned a 5.1 kb DNA fragment of the cis-regulatory region adjacent to the 50 end of the Vg gene of P. xylostella (PxVg). We identified two promoter sites in that 50 upstream sequence of PxVg and performed in vitro analysis of two promoter sequences (PxVgP1, 4.9 kb, and PxVgP2, 2.9 kb) in the embryonic cell line of P. xylostella. PxVgP2 exhibited higher enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression, so PxVgP2 was used for in vivo analysis. Strong EGFP fluorescence was observed in adult females and the fat body of females, with low expression in embryos. Our results suggest that PxVgP is an important stage-, tissue- and sex-specific endogenous cis-regulatory element in P. xylostella.},

@article{barnesMeioticRecombinationNoncoding1995,
	Abstract = {The genetic map of each Caenorhabditis elegans chromosome has a central gene cluster (less pronounced on the X chromosome) that contains most of the mutationally defined genes. Many linkage group termini also have clusters, though involving fewer loci. We examine the factors shaping the genetic map by analyzing the rate of recombination and gene density across the genome using the positions of cloned genes and random cDNA clones from the physical map. Each chromosome has a central gene-dense region (more diffuse on the X) with discrete boundaries, flanked by gene-poor regions. Only autosomes have reduced rates of recombination in these gene-dense regions. Cluster boundaries appear discrete also by recombination rate, and the boundaries defined by recombination rate and gene density mostly, but not always, coincide. Terminal clusters have greater gene densities than the adjoining arm but similar recombination rates. Thus, unlike in other species, most exchange in C. elegans occurs in gene-poor regions. The recombination rate across each cluster is constant and similar; and cluster size and gene number per chromosome are independent of the physical size of chromosomes. We propose a model of how this genome organization arose.},

@article{bartonGeneralModelEvolution1995,
	Abstract = {A general representation of multilocus selection is extended to allow recombination to depend on genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles have small effects on recombination. The evolution of such modifiers only depends on how they alter recombination between the selected loci, and does not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in two ways: because it impedes the response to epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it facilitates the response to directional selection. The first mechanism is implausible, because epistasis must change sign over periods of a few generations: faster or slower fluctuations favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism requires weak negative epistasis between favourable alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in check by mutation. The selection (si) on recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in additive variance of log (fitness) due to linkage disequilibria (υ1 {$<$} 0), and on non-additive variance in log (fitness) (V′2, V′3,.. epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci and pairwise epistasis, si = − (υ1 + 4V2/3)δr, where δr is the average increase in recombination caused by the modifier. The approximations are checked against exact calculations for three loci, and against Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection balance (1990), and directional selection (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation between selection on recombination and observable components of fitness variation, which is open to experimental test.},

@article{belleghemPatternsChromosomeDivergence2018,
	Abstract = {Sex chromosomes are disproportionately involved in reproductive isolation and adaptation. In support of such a ``large-X'' effect, genome scans between recently diverged populations and species pairs often identify distinct patterns of divergence on the sex chromosome compared to autosomes. When measures of divergence between populations are higher on the sex chromosome compared to autosomes, such patterns could be interpreted as evidence for faster divergence on the sex chromosome, that is ``faster-X'', barriers to gene flow on the sex chromosome. However, demographic changes can strongly skew divergence estimates and are not always taken into consideration. We used 224 whole-genome sequences representing 36 populations from two Heliconius butterfly clades (H. erato and H. melpomene) to explore patterns of Z chromosome divergence. We show that increased divergence compared to equilibrium expectations can in many cases be explained by demographic change. Among Heliconius erato populations, for instance, population size increase in the ancestral population can explain increased absolute divergence measures on the Z chromosome compared to the autosomes, as a result of increased ancestral Z chromosome genetic diversity. Nonetheless, we do identify increased divergence on the Z chromosome relative to the autosomes in parapatric or sympatric species comparisons that imply postzygotic reproductive barriers. Using simulations, we show that this is consistent with reduced gene flow on the Z chromosome, perhaps due to greater accumulation of incompatibilities. Our work demonstrates the importance of taking demography into account to interpret patterns of divergence on the Z chromosome, but nonetheless provides evidence to support the Z chromosome as a strong barrier to gene flow in incipient Heliconius butterfly species.},

@article{benjaminiControllingFalseDiscovery1995,
	Abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{blackmonMeioticDriveShapes2019,
	Abstract = {Chromosome number is perhaps the most basic characteristic of a genome, yet generalizations that can explain the evolution of this trait across large clades have remained elusive. Using karyotype data from over 1000 mammals, we developed and applied a phylogenetic model of chromosome evolution that links chromosome number changes with karyotype morphology. Using our model, we infer that rates of chromosome number evolution are significantly lower in species with karyotypes that consist of either all bibrachial or all monobrachial chromosomes than in species with a mix of both types of morphologies. We suggest that species with homogeneous karyotypes may represent cases where meiotic drive acts to stabilize the karyotype, favoring the chromosome morphologies already present in the genome. In contrast, rapid bouts of chromosome number evolution in taxa with mixed karyotypes may indicate that a switch in the polarity of female meiotic drive favors changes in chromosome number. We do not find any evidence that karyotype morphology affects rates of speciation or extinction. Furthermore, we document that switches in meiotic drive polarity are likely common and have occurred in most major clades of mammals, and that rapid remodeling of karyotypes may be more common than once thought.},

@article{blackmonSexDeterminationSex2017,
	Abstract = {Insects harbor a tremendous diversity of sex determining mechanisms both within and between groups. For example, in some orders such as Hymenoptera, all members are haplodiploid, whereas Diptera contain species with homomorphic as well as male and female heterogametic sex chromosome systems or paternal genome elimination. We have established a large database on karyotypes and sex chromosomes in insects, containing information on over 13000 species covering 29 orders of insects. This database constitutes a unique starting point to report phylogenetic patterns on the distribution of sex determination mechanisms, sex chromosomes, and karyotypes among insects and allows us to test general theories on the evolutionary dynamics of karyotypes, sex chromosomes, and sex determination systems in a comparative framework. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that male heterogamety is the ancestral mode of sex determination in insects, and transitions to female heterogamety are extremely rare. Many insect orders harbor species with complex sex chromosomes, and gains and losses of the sex-limited chromosome are frequent in some groups. Haplodiploidy originated several times within insects, and parthenogenesis is rare but evolves frequently. Providing a single source to electronically access data previously distributed among more than 500 articles and books will not only accelerate analyses of the assembled data, but also provide a unique resource to guide research on which taxa are likely to be informative to address specific questions, for example, for genome sequencing projects or large-scale comparative studies.},

@article{blountContingencyDeterminismEvolution2018,
	Abstract = {Historical processes display some degree of ``contingency,'' meaning their outcomes are sensitive to seemingly inconsequential events that can fundamentally change the future. Contingency is what makes historical outcomes unpredictable. Unlike many other natural phenomena, evolution is a historical process. Evolutionary change is often driven by the deterministic force of natural selection, but natural selection works upon variation that arises unpredictably through time by random mutation, and even beneficial mutations can be lost by chance through genetic drift. Moreover, evolution has taken place within a planetary environment with a particular history of its own. This tension between determinism and contingency makes evolutionary biology a kind of hybrid between science and history. While philosophers of science examine the nuances of contingency, biologists have performed many empirical studies of evolutionary repeatability and contingency. Here, we review the experimental and comparative evidence from these studies. Replicate populations in evolutionary ``replay'' experiments often show parallel changes, especially in overall performance, although idiosyncratic outcomes show that the particulars of a lineage's history can affect which of several evolutionary paths is taken. Comparative biologists have found many notable examples of convergent adaptation to similar conditions, but quantification of how frequently such convergence occurs is difficult. On balance, the evidence indicates that evolution tends to be surprisingly repeatable among closely related lineages, but disparate outcomes become more likely as the footprint of history grows deeper. Ongoing research on the structure of adaptive landscapes is providing additional insight into the interplay of fate and chance in the evolutionary process.},

@report{bohutinskaGenomicBasisParallel2020,
	Abstract = {Understanding the predictability of evolutionary change is of major importance in biology. Parallel adaptation provides unique insights through replicated natural experiments, yet mechanisms governing the ample variation in genomic parallelism remain unknown. Here, we investigate them using multi-scale genomic analyses of parallel evolution across populations, species and genera. By resequencing genomes of seven independent alpine lineages from two Arabidopsis species, we found that the degree of gene reuse decreases with increasing divergence between lineages. This relationship is well predicted by decreasing frequency of allele reuse, suggesting that availability of preexisting genetic variation is the prime mechanism. A meta-analysis demonstrated that the relationship further continues within the Brassicaceae family. Thus, we found empirical support for a longstanding hypothesis that the genetic basis of adaptive evolution is more predictable in closely related lineages while it becomes more contingent over larger evolutionary distances.},

@article{bomanEffectsGCBiasedGene2021,
	Abstract = {Recombination reshuffles the alleles of a population through crossover and gene conversion. These mechanisms have considerable consequences on the evolution and maintenance of genetic diversity. Crossover, for example, can increase genetic diversity by breaking the linkage between selected and nearby neutral variants. Bias in favor of G or C alleles during gene conversion may instead promote the fixation of one allele over the other, thus decreasing diversity. Mutation bias from G or C to A and T opposes GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). Less recognized is that these two processes may---when balanced---promote genetic diversity. Here, we investigate how gBGC and mutation bias shape genetic diversity patterns in wood white butterflies (Leptidea sp.). This constitutes the first in-depth investigation of gBGC in butterflies. Using 60 resequenced genomes from six populations of three species, we find substantial variation in the strength of gBGC across lineages. When modeling the balance of gBGC and mutation bias and comparing analytical results with empirical data, we reject gBGC as the main determinant of genetic diversity in these butterfly species. As alternatives, we consider linked selection and GC content. We find evidence that high values of both reduce diversity. We also show that the joint effects of gBGC and mutation bias can give rise to a diversity pattern which resembles the signature of linked selection. Consequently, gBGC should be considered when interpreting the effects of linked selection on levels of genetic diversity.},

@article{bookerVariationRecombinationRate2020,
	Abstract = {Genome scans can potentially identify genetic loci involved in evolutionary processes such as local adaptation and gene flow. Here, we show that recombination rate variation across a neutrally evolving genome gives rise to mixed sampling distributions of mean FST (F{\^S}T), a common population genetic summary statistic. In particular, we show that in regions of low recombination the distribution of F{\^S}T estimates has more variance and a longer tail than in more highly recombining regions. Determining outliers from the genome-wide distribution without taking local recombination rate into consideration may therefore increase the frequency of false positives in low recombination regions and be overly conservative in more highly recombining ones. We perform genome scans on simulated and empirical Drosophila melanogaster data sets and, in both cases, find patterns consistent with this neutral model. Similar patterns are observed for other summary statistics used to capture variation in the coalescent process. Linked selection, particularly background selection, is often invoked to explain heterogeneity in F{\^S}T across the genome, but here we point out that even under neutrality, statistical artefacts can arise due to variation in recombination rate. Our results highlight a flaw in the design of genome-scan studies and suggest that without estimates of local recombination rate, interpreting the genomic landscape of any summary statistic that captures variation in the coalescent process will be very difficult.},

@article{breeschotenExpandingMenuAre2022,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary expansions and contractions of gene families are often correlated with key innovations and/or ecological characteristics. In butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), expansions of gene families involved in detoxification of plant specialized metabolites are hypothesized to facilitate a polyphagous feeding style. However, analyses supporting this hypothesis are mostly based on a limited number of lepidopteran species. We applied a phylogenomics approach, using 37 lepidopteran genomes, to analyze if gene family evolution (gene gain and loss) is associated with the evolution of polyphagy. Specifically, we compared gene counts and evolutionary gene gain and loss rates of gene families involved in adaptations with plant feeding. We correlated gene evolution to host plant family range (phylogenetic diversity) and specialized metabolite content of plant families (functional metabolite diversity). We found a higher rate for gene loss than gene gain in Lepidoptera, a potential consequence of genomic rearrangements and deletions after (potentially small-scale) duplication events. Gene family expansions and contractions varied across lepidopteran families, and were associated to host plant use and specialization levels. Within the family Noctuidae, a higher expansion rate for gene families involved in detoxification can be related to the large number of polyphagous species. However, gene family expansions are observed in both polyphagous and monophagous lepidopteran species and thus seem to be species-specific in the taxa sampled. Nevertheless, a significant positive correlation of gene counts of the carboxyl- and choline esterase and glutathione-S-transferase detoxification gene families with the level of polyphagy was identified across Lepidoptera.},

Many of the conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) that constitute Drosophila cis-regulatory DNA, recognized by EvoPrinter alignment protocols, are also conserved in Ceratitis and Musca. Also conserved is the position but not necessarily the orientation of many of these ultraconserved CSBs (uCSBs) with respect to flanking genes. Using the mosquito EvoPrint algorithm, we have also identified uCSBs shared among distantly related mosquito species. Side by side comparison of bee and ant EvoPrints of selected developmental genes identify uCSBs shared between these two Hymenoptera, as well as less conserved CSBs in either one or the other taxon but not in both. Analysis of uCSBs in these dipterans and Hymenoptera will lead to a greater understanding of their evolutionary origin and function of their conserved non-coding sequences and aid in discovery of core elements of enhancers.},

@article{browerFuelingFallMigration2006,
	Abstract = {Monarch butterflies in eastern North America accumulate lipids during their fall migration to central Mexico, and use them as their energy source during a 5 month overwintering period. When and where along their migratory journey the butterflies accumulate these lipids has implications for the importance of fall nectar sources in North America. We analyzed the lipid content of 765 summer breeding and fall migrant monarch butterflies collected at 1 nectaring site in central Virginia over 4 years (1998--2001), and compared them with 16 additional published and unpublished datasets from other sites, dating back to 1941. Virginia migrants store significantly more lipid than summer butterflies, and show significant intraseason and between-year variation. None of the Virginia samples, and none of the historical samples, with one exception, had lipid levels comparable with those found in migrants that had reached Texas and northern Mexico. This evidence suggests that upon reaching Texas, the butterflies undergo a behavioral shift and spend more time nectaring. The one exceptional sample led us to the discovery that monarchs that form roosts along their migratory routes have higher lipid contents than monarchs collected while nectaring at flowers. We propose that for much of their journey monarchs are opportunistic migrants, and the variation within and between samples reflects butterflies' individual experiences. The stored lipids appear to be of less importance as fuel for the butterflies' migration than for their survival during their overwintering period, in part because soaring on favorable winds reduces the energetic cost of flying. The conservation of nectar plants in Texas and northern Mexico is crucial to sustaining the monarch's migratory spectacle, and nectar abundance throughout eastern North America is also important. As generalists in their selection of nectar sources and nectaring habitats, monarchs are unlikely to be affected by small changes in plant communities. Agricultural transformations of natural communities in the eastern United States and Great Plains, however, and especially the extensive planting of genetically modified herbicide-resistant soybeans and corn, may be changing the availability of nectar for monarchs and other pollinators. This new technology is eliminating virtually all forbs in and surrounding agricultural fields, including the monarch's larval hostplants (milkweeds) and native and nonnative nectar sources. To evaluate whether changes in nectar availability are altering the butterflies' ability to accumulate energy, we recommend that monarchs' lipid contents be assayed annually at sites throughout eastern North America.},

	Abstract = {The Quaternary climatic oscillations are expected to have had strong impacts on the evolution of species. Although legacies of the Quaternary climates on population processes have been widely identified in diverse groups of species, adaptive genetic changes shaped during the Quaternary have been harder to decipher. Here, we assembled a chromosome-level genome of the oriental fruit moth and compared genomic variation among refugial and colonized populations of this species that diverged in the Pleistocene. High genomic diversity was maintained in refugial populations. Demographic analysis showed that the effective population size of refugial populations declined during the penultimate glacial maximum (PGM) but remained stable during the last glacial maximum (LGM), indicating a strong impact of the PGM rather than the LGM on this pest species. Genome scans identified one chromosomal inversion and a mutation of the circadian gene Clk on the neo-Z chromosome potentially related to the endemicity of a refugial population. In the colonized populations, genes in pathways of energy metabolism and wing development showed signatures of selection. These different genomic signatures of refugial and colonized populations point to multiple impacts of Quaternary climates on adaptation in an extant species.},

@article{castellanoNearlyNeutralEvolution2018,
	Abstract = {Under the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the proportion of effectively neutral mutations is expected to depend upon the effective population size (Ne). Here, we investigate whether this is the case across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster using polymorphism data from North American and African lines. We show that the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms is negatively correlated to the number of synonymous polymorphisms, even when the nonindependence is accounted for. The relationship is such that the proportion of effectively neutral nonsynonymous mutations increases by ∼45\% as Ne is halved. However, we also show that this relationship is steeper than expected from an independent estimate of the distribution of fitness effects from the site frequency spectrum. We investigate a number of potential explanations for this and show, using simulation, that this is consistent with a model of genetic hitchhiking: Genetic hitchhiking depresses diversity at neutral and weakly selected sites, but has little effect on the diversity of strongly selected sites.},

Stacks now produces core population genomic summary statistics and SNP-by-SNP statistical tests. These statistics can be analysed across a reference genome using a smoothed sliding window. Stacks also now provides several output formats for several commonly used downstream analysis packages.

In order to facilitate the integration of genomic tools with a diverse body of ecological and evolutionary research, we assembled the genome of a Swedish comma using 10X sequencing, scaffolding with matepair data, genome polishing, and assignment to linkage groups using a high-density linkage map. The resulting genome is 373\,Mb in size, with a scaffold N50 of 11.7\,Mb and contig N50 of 11,2Mb. The genome contained 90.1\% of single-copy Lepidopteran orthologs in a BUSCO analysis of 5286 genes. A total of 21,004 gene-models were annotated on the genome using RNAseq data from larval and adult tissue in combination with proteins from the Arthropoda database, resulting in a high-quality annotation for which functional annotations were generated. We further documented the quality of the chromosomal assembly via synteny assessment with Melitaea cinxia. The resulting annotated, chromosome-level genome will provide an important resource for investigating coevolutionary dynamics and comparative analyses in Lepidoptera.},

@article{celorio-manceraEvolutionaryHistoryHost2016,
	Abstract = {Background: Although most insect species are specialized on one or few groups of plants, there are phytophagous insects that seem to use virtually any kind of plant as food. Understanding the nature of this ability to feed on a wide repertoire of plants is crucial for the control of pest species and for the elucidation of the macroevolutionary mechanisms of speciation and diversification of insect herbivores. Here we studied Vanessa cardui, the species with the widest diet breadth among butterflies and a potential insect pest, by comparing tissue-specific transcriptomes from caterpillars that were reared on different host plants. We tested whether the similarities of gene-expression response reflect the evolutionary history of adaptation to these plants in the Vanessa and related genera, against the null hypothesis of transcriptional profiles reflecting plant phylogenetic relatedness. Result: Using both unsupervised and supervised methods of data analysis, we found that the tissue-specific patterns of caterpillar gene expression are better explained by the evolutionary history of adaptation of the insects to the plants than by plant phylogeny. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that V. cardui may use two sets of expressed genes to achieve polyphagy, one associated with the ancestral capability to consume Rosids and Asterids, and another allowing the caterpillar to incorporate a wide range of novel host-plants.},

@article{CentromereTelomereMovements1996,
	Abstract = {The preconditions and early steps of meiotic chromosome pairing were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome- specific DNA probes to mouse and human testis tissue sections. Premeiotic pairing of homologous chromosomes was not detected in spermatogonia of the two species. FISH with centromere- and telomere- specific DNA probes in combination with immunostaining (IS) of synaptonemal complex (SC) proteins to testis sections of prepuberal mice at days 4-12 post partum was performed to study sequentially the meiotic pairing process. Movements of centromeres and then telomeres to the nuclear envelope, and of telomeres along the nuclear envelope leading to the formation of a chromosomal bouquet were detected during mouse prophase. At the bouquet stage, pairing of a mouse chromosome-8- specific probe was observed. SC-IS and simultaneous telomere FISH revealed that axial element proteins appear as large aggregates in mouse meiocytes when telomeres are attached to the nuclear envelope. Axial element formation initiates during tight telomere clustering and transverse filament-IS indicated the initiation of synapsis during this stage. Comparison of telomere and centromere distribution patterns of mouse and human meiocytes revealed movements of centromeres and then telomeres to the nuclear envelope and subsequent bouquet formation as conserved motifs of the pairing process. Chromosome painting in human spermatogonia revealed compacted, largely mutually exclusive chromosome territories. The territories developed into long, thin threads at the onset of meiotic prophase. Based on these results a unified model of the pairing process is proposed.},

	Abstract = {The rapid evolution of repetitive DNA sequences, including satellite DNA, tandem duplications, and transposable elements, underlies phenotypic evolution and contributes to hybrid incompatibilities between species. However, repetitive genomic regions are fragmented and misassembled in most contemporary genome assemblies. We generated highly contiguous de novo reference genomes for the Drosophila simulans species complex (D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia), which speciated ∼250,000 yr ago. Our assemblies are comparable in contiguity and accuracy to the current D. melanogaster genome, allowing us to directly compare repetitive sequences between these four species. We find that at least 15\% of the D. simulans complex species genomes fail to align uniquely to D. melanogaster owing to structural divergence---twice the number of single-nucleotide substitutions. We also find rapid turnover of satellite DNA and extensive structural divergence in heterochromatic regions, whereas the euchromatic gene content is mostly conserved. Despite the overall preservation of gene synteny, euchromatin in each species has been shaped by clade- and species-specific inversions, transposable elements, expansions and contractions of satellite and tRNA tandem arrays, and gene duplications. We also find rapid divergence among Y-linked genes, including copy number variation and recent gene duplications from autosomes. Our assemblies provide a valuable resource for studying genome evolution and its consequences for phenotypic evolution in these genetic model species.},

The spectacular migrations of large day-flying insects have long fascinated humankind, and since the advent of radar entomology much has been revealed about high-altitude night-time insect migrations. Over the last decade, there have been significant advances in insect migration research, which we review here. In particular, we highlight: (1) notable improvements in our understanding of lepidopteran navigation strategies, including the hitherto unsuspected capabilities of high-altitude migrants to select favourable winds and orientate adaptively, (2) progress in unravelling the neuronal mechanisms underlying sun compass orientation and in identifying the genetic complex underpinning key traits associated with migration behaviour and performance in the monarch butterfly, and (3) improvements in our knowledge of the multifaceted interactions between disease agents and insect migrants, in terms of direct effects on migration success and pathogen spread, and indirect effects on the evolution of migratory systems. We conclude by highlighting the progress that can be made through inter-phyla comparisons, and identify future research areas that will enhance our understanding of insect migration strategies within an eco-evolutionary perspective.},

	Abstract = {Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and other polyphagous agricultural pests are extending their plant host range and emerging as serious agents in restraining crop productivity. Dynamic regulation, coupled with a diversity of digestive and detoxifying enzymes, play a crucial role in the adaptation of polyphagous insects. To investigate the functional intricacy of serine proteases in the development and polyphagy of H. armigera, we profiled the expression of eight trypsin-like and four chymotrypsin-like phylogenetically diverse mRNAs from different life stages of H. armigera reared on nutritionally distinct host plants. These analyses revealed diet- and stagespecific protease expression patterns. The trypsins expressed showed structural variations, which might result in differential substrate specificity and interaction with inhibitors. Protease profiles in the presence of inhibitors and their mass spectrometric analyses revealed insight into their differential activity. These findings emphasize the differential expression of serine proteases and their consequences for digestive physiology in promoting polyphagy in H. armigera.},

@article{chowdhuryMigrationButterfliesGlobal2021,
	Abstract = {Insect populations including butterflies are declining worldwide, and they are becoming an urgent conservation priority in many regions. Understanding which butterfly species migrate is critical to planning for their conservation, because management actions for migrants need to be coordinated across time and space. Yet, while migration appears to be widespread among butterflies, its prevalence, as well as its taxonomic and geographic distribution are poorly understood. The study of insect migration is hampered by their small size and the difficulty of tracking individuals over long distances. Here we review the literature on migration in butterflies, one of the best-known insect groups. We find that nearly 600 butterfly species show evidence of migratory movements. Indeed, the rate of `discovery' of migratory movements in butterflies suggests that many more species might in fact be migratory. Butterfly migration occurs across all families, in tropical as well as temperate taxa; Nymphalidae has more migratory species than any other family (275 species), and Pieridae has the highest proportion of migrants (13\%; 133 species). Some 13 lines of evidence have been used to ascribe migration status in the literature, but only a single line of evidence is available for 92\% of the migratory species identified, with four or more lines of evidence available for only 10 species -- all from the Pieridae and Nymphalidae. Migratory butterflies occur worldwide, although the geographic distribution of migration in butterflies is poorly resolved, with most data so far coming from Europe, USA, and Australia. Migration is much more widespread in butterflies than previously realised -- extending far beyond the well-known examples of the monarch Danaus plexippus and the painted lady Vanessa cardui -- and actions to conserve butterflies and insects in general must account for the spatial dependencies introduced by migratory movements.},

@article{cicconardiChromosomeFusionAffects2021a,
	Abstract = {Major changes in chromosome number and structure are linked to a series of evolutionary phenomena, including intrinsic barriers to gene flow or suppression of recombination due to chromosomal rearrangements. However, chromosome rearrangements can also affect the fundamental dynamics of molecular evolution within populations by changing relationships between linked loci and altering rates of recombination. Here, we build chromosome-level assembly Eueides isabella and, together with a recent chromosome-level assembly of Dryas iulia, examine the evolutionary consequences of multiple chromosome fusions in Heliconius butterflies. These assemblies pinpoint fusion points on 10 of the 20 autosomal chromosomes and reveal striking differences in the characteristics of fused and unfused chromosomes. The ten smallest autosomes in D. iulia and E. isabella, which have each fused to a longer chromosome in Heliconius, have higher repeat and GC content, and longer introns than predicted by their chromosome length. When fused, these characteristics change to become more in line with chromosome length. The fusions also led to reduced diversity, which likely reflects increased background selection and selection against introgression between diverging populations, following a reduction in per-base recombination rate. We further show that chromosome size and fusion impact turnover rates of functional loci at a macroevolutionary scale. Together these results provide further evidence that chromosome fusion in Heliconius likely had dramatic effects on population level processes shaping rates of neutral and adaptive divergence. These effects may have impacted patterns of diversification in Heliconius, a classic example of an adaptive radiation.},

Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow "hotspots." To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals, we used dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60\% of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots.},

@article{craigNaturalSelectionGenes2018,
	Abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that a significant proportion of the functional sequence within eukaryotic genomes is noncoding. However, since the identification of conserved elements (CEs) has been restricted to a limited number of model organisms, the dynamics and evolutionary character of the genomic landscape of conserved, and hence likely functional, sequence is poorly understood in most species. Moreover, identification and analysis of the full suite of functional sequence are particularly important for the understanding of the genetic basis of trait loci identified in genome scans or quantitative trait locus mapping efforts. We report that \textasciitilde 6.6\% of the collared flycatcher genome (74.0 Mb) is spanned by \textasciitilde 1.28 million CEs, a higher proportion of the genome but a lower total amount of conserved sequence than has been reported in mammals. We identified {$>$}200,000 CEs specific to either the archosaur, avian, neoavian or passeridan lineages, constituting candidates for lineage-specific adaptations. Importantly, no less than \textasciitilde 71\% of CE sites were nonexonic (52.6 Mb), and conserved nonexonic sequence density was negatively correlated with functional exonic density at local genomic scales. Additionally, nucleotide diversity was strongly reduced at nonexonic conserved sites (0.00153) relative to intergenic nonconserved sites (0.00427). By integrating deep transcriptome sequencing and additional genome annotation, we identified novel protein-coding genes, long noncoding RNA genes and transposon-derived (exapted) CEs. The approach taken here based on the use of a PROGRESSIVE CACTUS whole-genome alignment to identify CEs should be readily applicable to nonmodel organisms in general and help to reveal the rich repertoire of putatively functional noncoding sequence as targets for selection.},

	Abstract = {Developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.},

	Abstract = {The domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, is an important model system for the order Lepidoptera. Currently, based on third-generation sequencing, the chromosome-level genome of Bombyx mori has been released. However, its transcripts were mainly assembled by using short reads of second-generation sequencing and expressed sequence tags which cannot explain the transcript profile accurately. Here, we used PacBio Iso-Seq technology to investigate the transcripts from 45 developmental stages of Bombyx mori. We obtained 25,970 non-redundant high-quality consensus isoforms capturing ∼60\% of previous reported RNAs, 15,431 (∼47\%) novel transcripts, and identified 7,253 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with a large proportion of novel lncRNA (∼56\%). In addition, we found that transposable elements (TEs) exonization account for 11,671 (∼45\%) transcripts including 5,980 protein-coding transcripts (∼32\%) and 5,691 lncRNAs (∼79\%). Overall, our results expand the silkworm transcripts and have general implications to understand the interaction between TEs and their host genes. These transcripts resource will promote functional studies of genes and lncRNAs as well as TEs in the silkworm.},

	Abstract = {The Heliconius butterflies are a widely studied adaptive radiation of 46 species spread across Central and South America, several of which are known to hybridize in the wild. Here, we present a substantially improved assembly of the Heliconius melpomene genome, developed using novel methods that should be applicable to improving other genome assemblies produced using short read sequencing. First, we wholegenome-sequenced a pedigree to produce a linkage map incorporating 99\% of the genome. Second, we incorporated haplotype scaffolds extensively to produce a more complete haploid version of the draft genome. Third, we incorporated  20x coverage of Pacific Biosciences sequencing, and scaffolded the haploid genome using an assembly of this long-read sequence. These improvements result in a genome of 795 scaffolds, 275 Mb in length, with an N50 length of 2.1 Mb, an N50 number of 34, and with 99\% of the genome placed, and 84\% anchored on chromosomes. We use the new genome assembly to confirm that the Heliconius genome underwent 10 chromosome fusions since the split with its sister genus Eueides, over a period of about 6 million yr.},

@article{daveyNoEvidenceMaintenance2017,
	Abstract = {Mechanisms that suppress recombination are known to help maintain species barriers by preventing the breakup of coadapted gene combinations. The sympatric butterfly species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno are separated by many strong barriers, but the species still hybridize infrequently in the wild, and around 40\% of the genome is influenced by introgression. We tested the hypothesis that genetic barriers between the species are maintained by inversions or other mechanisms that reduce between-species recombination rate. We constructed fine-scale recombination maps for Panamanian populations of both species and their hybrids to directly measure recombination rate within and between species, and generated long sequence reads to detect inversions. We find no evidence for a systematic reduction in recombination rates in F1 hybrids, and also no evidence for inversions longer than 50 kb that might be involved in generating or maintaining species barriers. This suggests that mechanisms leading to global or local reduction in recombination do not play a significant role in the maintenance of species barriers between H. melpomene and H. cydno.},

Successful comparisons of distantly related species will thus yield highly important sequence elements likely to serve fundamental biological roles. RNA regulatory elements are less well understood than those in DNA. In this study we use the emerging model organism                 Nasonia vitripennis                 , a parasitic wasp, in a comparative analysis against 12 insect genomes to identify deeply conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) conserved in large groups of insects, with a focus on 5' UTRs and promoter sequences.                                                        Results                                We report the identification of 322 CNEs conserved across a broad range of insect orders. The identified regions are associated with regulatory and developmental genes, and contain short footprints revealing aspects of their likely function in translational regulation. The most ancient regions identified in our analysis were all found to overlap transcribed regions of genes, reflecting stronger conservation of translational regulatory elements than transcriptional elements. Further expanding sequence analyses to non-insect species we also report the discovery of, to our knowledge, the two oldest and most ubiquitous CNE's yet described in the animal kingdom (700 MYA). These ancient conserved non-coding elements are associated with the two ribosomal stalk genes,                 RPLP1                 and                 RPLP2                 , and were very likely functional in some of the earliest animals.                                                        Conclusions               We report the identification of the most deeply conserved CNE's found to date, and several other deeply conserved elements which are without exception, part of 5' untranslated regions of transcripts, and occur in a number of key translational regulatory genes, highlighting translational regulation of translational regulators as a conserved feature of insect genomes.},

@article{daySpecializationEvolutionaryDead2016,
	Abstract = {Specialization has often been claimed to be an evolutionary dead end, with specialist lineages having a reduced capacity to persist or diversify. In a phylogenetic comparative framework, an evolutionary dead end may be detectable from the phylogenetic distribution of specialists, if specialists rarely give rise to large, diverse clades. Previous phylogenetic studies of the influence of specialization on macroevolutionary processes have demonstrated a range of patterns, including examples where specialists have both higher and lower diversification rates than generalists, as well as examples where the rates of evolutionary transitions from generalists to specialists are higher, lower or equal to transitions from specialists to generalists. Here, we wish to ask whether these varied answers are due to the differences in macroevolutionary processes in different clades, or partly due to differences in methodology. We analysed ten phylogenies containing multiple independent origins of specialization and quantified the phylogenetic distribution of specialists by applying a common set of metrics to all datasets. We compared the tip branch lengths of specialists to generalists, the size of specialist clades arising from each evolutionary origin of a specialized trait and whether specialists tend to be clustered or scattered on phylogenies. For each of these measures, we compared the observed values to expectations under null models of trait evolution and expected outcomes under alternative macroevolutionary scenarios. We found that specialization is sometimes an evolutionary dead end: in two of the ten case studies (pollinator-specific plants and hostspecific flies), specialization is associated with a reduced rate of diversification or trait persistence. However, in the majority of studies, we could not distinguish the observed phylogenetic distribution of specialists from null models in which specialization has no effect on diversification or trait persistence.},

@article{deiningerAluRepeatsHuman1999,
	Abstract = {Alu elements have amplified in primate genomes through a RNA-dependent mechanism, termed retroposition, and have reached a copy number in excess of 500,000 copies per human genome. These elements have been proposed to have a number of functions in the human genome, and have certainly had a major impact on genomic architecture. Alu elements continue to amplify at a rate of about one insertion every 200 new births. We have found 16 examples of diseases caused by the insertion of Alu elements, suggesting that they may contribute to about 0.1\% of human genetic disorders by this mechanism. The large number of Alu elements within primate genomes also provides abundant opportunities for unequal homologous recombination events. These events often occur intrachromosomally, resulting in deletion or duplication of exons in a gene, but they also can occur interchromosomally, causing more complex chromosomal abnormalities. We have found 33 cases of germ-line genetic diseases and 16 cases of cancer caused by unequal homologous recombination between Alu repeats. We estimate that this mode of mutagenesis accounts for another 0.3\% of human genetic diseases. Between these different mechanisms, Alu elements have not only contributed a great deal to the evolution of the genome but also continue to contribute to a significant portion of human genetic diseases.},

@article{delapazcelorio-manceraMechanismsMacroevolutionPolyphagous2013,
	Abstract = {Transcriptome studies of insect herbivory are still rare, yet studies in model systems have uncovered patterns of transcript regulation that appear to provide insights into how insect herbivores attain polyphagy, such as a general increase in expression breadth and regulation of ribosomal, digestion- and detoxification-related genes. We investigated the potential generality of these emerging patterns, in the Swedish comma, Polygonia c-album, which is a polyphagous, widely-distributed butterfly. Urtica dioica and Ribes uva-crispa are hosts of P. c-album, but Ribes represents a recent evolutionary shift onto a very divergent host. Utilizing the assembled transcriptome for read mapping, we assessed gene expression finding that caterpillar life-history (i.e. 2nd vs. 4th-instar regulation) had a limited influence on gene expression plasticity. In contrast, differential expression in response to host-plant identified genes encoding serine-type endopeptidases, membrane-associated proteins and transporters. Differential regulation of genes involved in nucleic acid binding was also observed suggesting that polyphagy involves large scale transcriptional changes. Additionally, transcripts coding for structural constituents of the cuticle were differentially expressed in caterpillars in response to their diet indicating that the insect cuticle may be a target for plant defence. Our results state that emerging patterns of transcript regulation from model species appear relevant in species when placed in an evolutionary context.},

@article{dengCharacterizationFirstWSpecific2020,
	Abstract = {Helicoverpa armigera is a globally-important crop pest with a WZ (female)/ZZ (male) sex chromosome system. The absence of discernible sexual dimorphism in its egg and larval stages makes it impossible to address any sex-related theoretical and applied questions before pupation unless a W-specific sequence marker is available for sex diagnosis. To this end, we used one pair of morphologically pre-sexed pupae to PCR-screen 17 non-transposon transcripts selected from 4855 W-linked candidate reads identified by mapping a publicly available egg transcriptome of both sexes to the male genome of this species and detected the read SRR1015458.67499 only in the female pupa. Subsequent PCR screenings of this read and the previously reported female-specific RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) marker AF18 with ten more pairs of pre-sexed pupae and different annealing positions and/or temperatures as well as its co-occurrence with the female-specific transcript splicing isoforms of doublesex gene of H. armigera (Hadsx) and amplification and sequencing of their 5′ unknown flanking sequences in three additional pairs of pre-sexed pupae verified that SRR1015458.67499 is a single copy protein-coding gene unique to W chromosome (named GUW1) while AF18 is a multicopy MITE transposon located on various chromosomes. Test application of GUW1 as a marker to sex 30 neonates of H. armigera yielded a female/male ratio of 1.14: 1.00. Both GUW1 and Hadsx splicing isoforms assays revealed that the H. armigera embryo cell line QB-Ha-E-1 is a male cell line. Taken together, GUW1 is not only a reliable DNA marker for sexing all stages of H. armigera and its cell lines, but also represents the first W-specific protein-coding gene in lepidopterans.},

@article{devosSpeciationChromosomalFusion2020,
	Abstract = {Changes in chromosome numbers may strongly affect reproductive barriers, because individuals heterozygous for distinct karyotypes are typically expected to be at least partially sterile or to show reduced recombination. Therefore, several classic speciation models are based on chromosomal changes. One import mechanism generating variation in chromosome numbers is fusion and fission of existing chromosomes, which is particularly likely in species with holocentric chromosomes, i.e. chromosomes that lack a single centromere. Holocentric chromosomes evolved repeatedly across the tree of life, including in Lepidoptera               .               Although changes in chromosome numbers are hypothesized to be an important driver of the spectacular diversification of Lepidoptera, comparative studies across the order are lacking. We performed the first comprehensive literature survey of karyotypes for Lepidoptera species since the 1970s and tested if, and how, chromosomal variation might affect speciation. Even though a meta-analysis of karyological differences between closely related taxa did not reveal an effect on the degree of reproductive isolation, phylogenetic diversification rate analyses across the 16 best-covered genera indicated a strong, positive association of rates of chromosome number evolution and speciation. These findings suggest a macroevolutionary impact of varying chromosome numbers in Lepidoptera and likely apply to other taxonomic groups, especially to those with holocentric chromosomes.                          This article is part of the theme issue `Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers'.},

As European butterflies are arguably the best-studied group of invertebrates in the world, the discovery of a cryptic species, twenty years ago, within the common wood white Leptidea sinapis was a significant event, and these butterflies have become a model to study speciation. Here we show that the so-called 'sibling' Leptidea actually consist of three species. The new species can be discriminated on the basis of either DNA or karyological data. Such an unexpected discovery challenges our current knowledge on biodiversity, exemplifying how a widespread species can remain unnoticed even within an intensely studied natural model system for speciation.},

@article{DNASequenceEvolution1995,
	Abstract = {Silent sites (positions that can undergo synonymous substitutions) in protein-coding genes can illuminate two evolutionary processes. First, despite being silent, they may be subject to natural selection. Among eukaryotes this is exemplified by yeast, where synonymous codon usage patterns are shaped by selection for particular codons that are more efficiently and/or accurately translated by the most abundant tRNAs; codon usage across the genome, and the abundance of different tRNA species, are highly co-adapted. Second, in the absence of selection, silent sites reveal underlying mutational patterns. Codon usage varies enormously among human genes, and yet silent sites do not appear to be influenced by natural selection, suggesting that mutation patterns vary among regions of the genome. At first, the yeast and human genomes were thought to reflect a dichotomy between unicellular and multicellular organisms. However, it now appears that natural selection shapes codon usage in some multicellular species (e.g. Drosophila and Caenorhabditis), and that regional variations in mutation biases occur in yeast. Silent sites (in serine codons) also provide evidence for mutational events changing adjacent nucleotides simultaneously.},

@article{dukicHighdensityGeneticMap2016,
	Abstract = {Background: Recombination rate is an essential parameter for many genetic analyses. Recombination rates are highly variable across species, populations, individuals and different genomic regions. Due to the profound influence that recombination can have on intraspecific diversity and interspecific divergence, characterization of recombination rate variation emerges as a key resource for population genomic studies and emphasises the importance of high-density genetic maps as tools for studying genome biology. Here we present such a high-density genetic map for Daphnia magna, and analyse patterns of recombination rate across the genome. Results: A F2 intercross panel was genotyped by Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing to construct the third-generation linkage map of D. magna. The resulting high-density map included 4037 markers covering 813 scaffolds and contigs that sum up to 77 \% of the currently available genome draft sequence (v2.4) and 55 \% of the estimated genome size (238 Mb). Total genetic length of the map presented here is 1614.5 cM and the genome-wide recombination rate is estimated to 6.78 cM/Mb. Merging genetic and physical information we consistently found that recombination rate estimates are high towards the peripheral parts of the chromosomes, while chromosome centres, harbouring centromeres in D. magna, show very low recombination rate estimates. Conclusions: Due to its high-density, the third-generation linkage map for D. magna can be coupled with the draft genome assembly, providing an essential tool for genome investigation in this model organism. Thus, our linkage map can be used for the on-going improvements of the genome assembly, but more importantly, it has enabled us to characterize variation in recombination rate across the genome of D. magna for the first time. These new insights can provide a valuable assistance in future studies of the genome evolution, mapping of quantitative traits and population genetic studies.},

@article{duretExpressionPatternSurprisingly1999,
	Abstract = {We measured the expression pattern and analyzed codon usage in 8,133, 1,550, and 2,917 genes, respectively, from Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana. In those three species, we observed a clear correlation between codon usage and gene expression levels and showed that this correlation is not due to a mutational bias. This provides direct evidence for selection on silent sites in those three distantly related multicellular eukaryotes. Surprisingly, there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage and protein length. This effect is not due to a smaller size of highly expressed proteins. Thus, for a same-expression pattern, the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. This puzzling observation is not predicted by any of the current models of selection on codon usage and thus raises the question of how translation efficiency affects fitness in multicellular organisms.},

@article{duretTransposonsNotRetrotransposons2000,
	Abstract = {We analyzed the distribution of transposable elements (TEs: transposons, LTR retrotransposons, and non-LTR retrotransposons) in the chromosomes of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The density of transposons (DNA-based elements) along the chromosomes was found to be positively correlated with recombination rate, but this relationship was not observed for LTR or non-LTR retrotransposons (RNAbased elements). Gene (coding region) density is higher in regions of low recombination rate. However, the lower TE density in these regions is not due to the counterselection of TE insertions within exons since the same positive correlation between TE density and recombination rate was found in noncoding regions (both in introns and intergenic DNA). These data are not compatible with a global model of selection acting against TE insertions, for which an accumulation of elements in regions of reduced recombination is expected. We also found no evidence for a stronger selection against TE insertions on the X chromosome compared to the autosomes. The difference in distribution of the DNA and RNAbased elements along the chromosomes in relation to recombination rate can be explained by differences in the transposition processes.},

	Abstract = {We used 20 de novo genome assemblies to probe the speciation history and architecture of gene flow in rapidly radiating               Heliconius               butterflies. Our tests to distinguish incomplete lineage sorting from introgression indicate that gene flow has obscured several ancient phylogenetic relationships in this group over large swathes of the genome. Introgressed loci are underrepresented in low-recombination and gene-rich regions, consistent with the purging of foreign alleles more tightly linked to incompatibility loci. Here, we identify a hitherto unknown inversion that traps a color pattern switch locus. We infer that this inversion was transferred between lineages by introgression and is convergent with a similar rearrangement in another part of the genus. These multiple de novo genome sequences enable improved understanding of the importance of introgression and selective processes in adaptive radiation.},

@article{espelandComprehensiveDatedPhylogenomic2018,
	Abstract = {Butterflies (Papilionoidea), with over 18,000 described species [1], have captivated naturalists and scientists~for centuries. They play a central role in the study of speciation, community ecology, biogeography, climate change, and plant-insect interactions and include many model organisms and pest species [2, 3]. However, a robust higher-level phylogenetic framework is lacking. To fill this gap, we inferred a dated phylogeny by analyzing the first phylogenomic dataset, including 352 loci ({$>$} 150,000~bp) from 207 species representing 98\% of tribes, a 35-fold increase in gene sampling and 3-fold increase in taxon sampling over previous studies [4]. Most data were generated with a new anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) [5] gene kit (BUTTERFLY1.0) that includes both new and~frequently used (e.g., [6]) informative loci, enabling direct comparison and future dataset merging with previous studies. Butterflies originated around 119 million years ago (mya) in the late Cretaceous, but most extant lineages diverged after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass-extinction 65 mya. Our analyses support swallowtails (Papilionidae) as sister to all other butterflies, followed by skippers (Hesperiidae)~+ the nocturnal butterflies (Hedylidae) as sister to the remainder, indicating a secondary reversal from diurnality to nocturnality. The whites (Pieridae) were strongly supported as sister to brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae) and blues~+ metalmarks (Lycaenidae and Riodinidae). Ant association independently evolved once in Lycaenidae and twice in Riodinidae. This study overturns prior notions of the taxon's evolutionary history, as many long-recognized subfamilies and tribes are para- or polyphyletic. It also provides a much-needed backbone for a revised classification of butterflies and~for future comparative studies including genome evolution and ecology.},

	Abstract = {The controversy over the cvolutionary advantage of recombination initially discovered by FISHEaRnd by MULLERis reviewed. Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none.

HILLand ROBERTSOfNound that the average effect 06 this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of FISHEaRnd MULLERI.t also predicts the ``ratchet mechanism'' discovered by MULLER,who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favcrable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the ariginal FISHER-MULLER argument and the reality of the MULLERratchet mechanism. It is argued that thesc constitute an ilitrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection f o r tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capabl3 of accounting for its origin.},

@article{flagelUnreasonableEffectivenessConvolutional2019,
	Abstract = {Population-scale genomic data sets have given researchers incredible amounts of information from which to infer evolutionary histories. Concomitant with this flood of data, theoretical and methodological advances have sought to extract information from genomic sequences to infer demographic events such as population size changes and gene flow among closely related populations/species, construct recombination maps, and uncover loci underlying recent adaptation. To date, most methods make use of only one or a few summaries of the input sequences and therefore ignore potentially useful information encoded in the data. The most sophisticated of these approaches involve likelihood calculations, which require theoretical advances for each new problem, and often focus on a single aspect of the data (e.g., only allele frequency information) in the interest of mathematical and computational tractability. Directly interrogating the entirety of the input sequence data in a likelihood-free manner would thus offer a fruitful alternative. Here, we accomplish this by representing DNA sequence alignments as images and using a class of deep learning methods called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to make population genetic inferences from these images. We apply CNNs to a number of evolutionary questions and find that they frequently match or exceed the accuracy of current methods. Importantly, we show that CNNs perform accurate evolutionary model selection and parameter estimation, even on problems that have not received detailed theoretical treatments. Thus, when applied to population genetic alignments, CNNs are capable of outperforming expert-derived statistical methods and offer a new path forward in cases where no likelihood approach exists.},

@report{flynnRepeatModeler2AutomatedGenomic2019,
	Abstract = {Abstract                        The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components such as transposable elements (TEs). Because the types and sequences of TEs are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, a new pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This new program brings substantial improvements over the original version of RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete LTR retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated TE libraries:             Drosophila melanogaster             (fruit fly),             Danio rerio             (zebrafish), and             Oryza sativa             (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified approximately three times more consensus sequences matching with {$>$}95\% sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is for LTR retroelements. The program had an extremely low false positive rate when applied to simulated genomes devoid of TEs. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences. RepeatModeler2 is available as source code or a containerized package under an open license (             https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler             ,             https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/TETools             ).                                   Significance             Genome sequences are being produced for more and more eukaryotic species. The bulk of these genomes is composed of parasitic, self-mobilizing transposable elements (TEs) that play important roles in organismal evolution. Thus there is a pressing need for developing software that can accurately identify the diverse set of TEs dispersed in genome sequences. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, an easy-to-use package for the curation of reference TE libraries which can be applied to any eukaryotic species. Through several major improvements over the previous version, RepeatModeler2 is able to produce libraries that recapitulate the known composition of three model species with some of the most complex TE landscapes. Thus RepeatModeler2 will greatly enhance the discovery and annotation of TEs in genome sequences.},

@article{fraisseDeepConservationLepidoptera2017,
	Abstract = {Moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) usually have a pair of differentiated WZ sex chromosomes. However, in most lineages outside of the division Ditrysia, as well as in the sister order Trichoptera, females lack a W chromosome. The W is therefore thought to have been acquired secondarily. Here we compare the genomes of three Lepidoptera species (one Dytrisia and two non-Dytrisia) to test three models accounting for the origin of the W: (1) a Z-autosome fusion; (2) a sex chromosome turnover; and (3) a non-canonical mechanism (e.g., through the recruitment of a B chromosome). We show that the gene content of the Z is highly conserved across Lepidoptera (rejecting a sex chromosome turnover) and that very few genes moved onto the Z in the common ancestor of the Ditrysia (arguing against a Z-autosome fusion). Our comparative genomics analysis therefore supports the secondary acquisition of the Lepidoptera W by a non-canonical mechanism, and it confirms the extreme stability of well-differentiated sex chromosomes.},

@article{fujiwaraTelomerespecificNonLTRRetrotransposons2005,
	Abstract = {Most insects have telomeres that consist of pentanucleotide (TTAGG) telomeric repeats, which are synthesized by telomerase. However, all species in Diptera so far examined and several species in other orders of insect have lost the (TTAGG)n repeats, suggesting that some of them recruit telomerase-independent telomere maintenance. The silkworm, Bombyx mori, retains the TTAGG motifs in the chromosomal ends but expresses quite a low level of telomerase activity in all stages of various tissues. Just proximal to a 6Y8-kb stretch of the TTAGG repeats in B. mori, more than 1000 copies of non-LTR retrotransposons, designated TRAS and SART families, occur among the telomeric repeats and accumulate. TRAS and SART are abundantly transcribed and actively retrotransposed into TTAGG telomeric repeats in a highly sequence-specific manner. They have three possible mechanisms to ensure specific integration into the telomeric repeats. This article focuses on the telomere structure and telomere-specific non-LTR retrotransposons in B. mori and discusses the mechanisms for telomere maintenance in this insect.},

@article{gagniucEukaryoticGenomesMay2012,
	Abstract = {Background: The main function of gene promoters appears to be the integration of different gene products in their biological pathways in order to maintain homeostasis. Generally, promoters have been classified in two major classes, namely TATA and CpG. Nevertheless, many genes using the same combinatorial formation of transcription factors have different gene expression patterns. Accordingly, we tried to ask ourselves some fundamental questions: Why certain genes have an overall predisposition for higher gene expression levels than others? What causes such a predisposition? Is there a structural relationship of these sequences in different tissues? Is there a strong phylogenetic relationship between promoters of closely related species? Results: In order to gain valuable insights into different promoter regions, we obtained a series of image-based patterns which allowed us to identify 10 generic classes of promoters. A comprehensive analysis was undertaken for promoter sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens and Oryza sativa, and a more extensive analysis of tissue-specific promoters in humans. We observed a clear preference for these species to use certain classes of promoters for specific biological processes. Moreover, in humans, we found that different tissues use distinct classes of promoters, reflecting an emerging promoter network. Depending on the tissue type, comparisons made between these classes of promoters reveal a complementarity between their patterns whereas some other classes of promoters have been observed to occur in competition. Furthermore, we also noticed the existence of some transitional states between these classes of promoters that may explain certain evolutionary mechanisms, which suggest a possible predisposition for specific levels of gene expression and perhaps for a different number of factors responsible for triggering gene expression. Our conclusions are based on comprehensive data from three different databases and a new computer model whose core is using Kappa index of coincidence. Conclusions: To fully understand the connections between gene promoters and gene expression, we analyzed thousands of promoter sequences using our Kappa Index of Coincidence method and a specialized Optical Character Recognition (OCR) neural network. Under our criteria, 10 classes of promoters were detected. In addition, the existence of ``transitional'' promoters suggests that there is an evolutionary weighted continuum between classes, depending perhaps upon changes in their gene products.},

@article{gamberale-stilleHostPlantChoice2014,
	Abstract = {In most phytophagous insects, the larval diet strongly affects future fitness and in species that do not feed on plant parts as adults, larval diet is the main source of nitrogen. In many of these insect--host plant systems, the immature larvae are considered to be fully dependent on the choice of the mothers, who, in turn, possess a highly developed host recognition system. This circumstance allows for a potential mother--offspring conflict, resulting in the female maximizing her fecundity at the expense of larval performance on suboptimal hosts. In two experiments, we aimed to investigate this relationship in the polyphagous comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, by comparing the relative acceptance of low- and medium-ranked hosts between females and neonate larvae both within individuals between life stages, and between mothers and their offspring. The study shows a variation between females in oviposition acceptance of low-ranked hosts, and that the degree of acceptance in the mothers correlates with the probability of acceptance of the same host in the larvae. We also found a negative relationship between stages within individuals as there was a higher acceptance of lower ranked hosts in females who had abandoned said host as a larva. Notably, however, neonate larvae of the comma butterfly did not unconditionally accept to feed from the least favorable host species even when it was the only food source. Our results suggest the possibility that the disadvantages associated with a generalist oviposition strategy can be decreased by larval participation in host plant choice.},

@article{gleminQuantificationGCbiasedGene2015,
	Abstract = {Much evidence indicates that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) has a major impact on the evolution of mammalian genomes. However, a detailed quantification of the process is still lacking. The strength of gBGC can be measured from the analysis of derived allele frequency spectra (DAF), but this approach is sensitive to a number of confounding factors. In particular, we show by simulations that the inference is pervasively affected by polymorphism polarization errors and by spatial heterogeneity in gBGC strength. We propose a new general method to quantify gBGC from DAF spectra, incorporating polarization errors, taking spatial heterogeneity into account, and jointly estimating mutation bias. Applying it to human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that the strength of gBGC does not differ between hypermutable CpG sites and non-CpG sites, suggesting that in humans gBGC is not caused by the base-excision repair machinery. Genome-wide, the intensity of gBGC is in the nearly neutral area. However, given that recombination occurs primarily within recombination hotspots, 1\%--2\% of the human genome is subject to strong gBGC. On average, gBGC is stronger in African than in non-African populations, reflecting differences in effective population sizes. However, due to more heterogeneous recombination landscapes, the fraction of the genome affected by strong gBGC is larger in non-African than in African populations. Given that the location of recombination hotspots evolves very rapidly, our analysis predicts that, in the long term, a large fraction of the genome is affected by short episodes of strong gBGC.},

There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},

@article{guDichotomyDosageCompensation2019,
	Abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Mechanisms of sex chromosome dosage compensation (SCDC) differ strikingly among animals. In \emph{Drosophila} flies, chromosome-wide transcription is doubled from the single X chromosome in hemizygous (XY) males, whereas in \emph{Caenorhabditis} nematodes, expression is halved for both X copies in homozygous (XX) females [1, 2]. Unlike other female-heterogametic (WZ female and ZZ male) animals, moths and butterflies exhibit sex chromosome dosage compensation patterns typically seen only in male-heterogametic species [3]. The monarch butterfly carries a newly derived Z chromosome segment that arose from an autosomal fusion with the ancestral Z [4]. Using a highly contiguous genome assembly, we show that gene expression is balanced between sexes along the entire Z chromosome but with distinct modes of compensation on the two segments. On the ancestral Z segment, depletion of H4K16ac corresponds to nearly halving of biallelic transcription in males, a pattern convergent to nematodes. Conversely, the newly derived Z segment shows a \emph{Drosophila}-like mode of compensation, with enriched H4K16ac levels corresponding to doubled monoallelic transcription in females. Our work reveals that, contrary to the expectation of co-opting regulatory mechanisms readily in place, the evolution of plural modes of dosage compensation is also possible along a single sex chromosome within a species.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

	Abstract = {We use forward and coalescent models of population genetics to study chromosome fusions that reduce the recombination between two locally adapted loci. Under a continent--island model, a fusion spreads and reaches a polymorphic equilibrium when it causes recombination between locally adapted alleles to be less than their selective advantage. In contrast, fusions in a two-deme model always spread; whether it reaches a polymorphic equilibrium or becomes fixed depends on the relative recombination rates of fused homozygotes and heterozygotes. Neutral divergence around fusion polymorphisms is markedly increased, showing peaks at the point of fusion and at the locally adapted loci. Local adaptation could explain the evolution of many of chromosome fusions, which are some of the most common chromosome rearrangements in nature.},

@article{guhathakurtaComputationalIdentificationTranscriptional2006,
	Abstract = {Identification and annotation of all the functional elements in the genome, including genes and the regulatory sequences, is a fundamental challenge in genomics and computational biology. Since regulatory elements are frequently short and variable, their identification and discovery using computational algorithms is difficult. However, significant advances have been made in the computational methods for modeling and detection of DNA regulatory elements. The availability of complete genome sequence from multiple organisms, as well as mRNA profiling and high-throughput experimental methods for mapping protein-binding sites in DNA, have contributed to the development of methods that utilize these auxiliary data to inform the detection of transcriptional regulatory elements. Progress is also being made in the identification of cis-regulatory modules and higher order structures of the regulatory sequences, which is essential to the understanding of transcription regulation in the metazoan genomes. This article reviews the computational approaches for modeling and identification of genomic regulatory elements, with an emphasis on the recent developments, and current challenges.},

@article{haenelMetaanalysisChromosomescaleCrossover2018,
	Abstract = {Understanding the distribution of crossovers along chromosomes is crucial to evolutionary genomics because the crossover rate determines how strongly a genome region is influenced by natural selection on linked sites. Nevertheless, generalities in the chromosome-scale distribution of crossovers have not been investigated formally. We fill this gap by synthesizing joint information on genetic and physical maps across 62 animal, plant and fungal species. Our quantitative analysis reveals a strong and taxonomically widespread reduction of the crossover rate in the centre of chromosomes relative to their peripheries. We demonstrate that this pattern is poorly explained by the position of the centromere, but find that the magnitude of the relative reduction in the crossover rate in chromosome centres increases with chromosome length. That is, long chromosomes often display a dramatically low crossover rate in their centre, whereas short chromosomes exhibit a relatively homogeneous crossover rate. This observation is compatible with a model in which crossover is initiated from the chromosome tips, an idea with preliminary support from mechanistic investigations of meiotic recombination. Consequently, we show that organisms achieve a higher genome-wide crossover rate by evolving smaller chromosomes. Summarizing theory and providing empirical examples, we finally highlight that taxonomically widespread and systematic heterogeneity in crossover rate along chromosomes generates predictable broad-scale trends in genetic diversity and population differentiation by modifying the impact of natural selection among regions within a genome. We conclude by emphasizing that chromosome-scale heterogeneity in crossover rate should urgently be incorporated into analytical tools in evolutionary genomics, and in the interpretation of resulting patterns.},

@article{hammerCaterpillarsLackResident2017,
	Abstract = {Many animals are inhabited by microbial symbionts that influence their hosts' development, physiology, ecological interactions, and evolutionary diversification. However, firm evidence for the existence and functional importance of resident microbiomes in larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars) is lacking, despite the fact that these insects are enormously diverse, major agricultural pests, and dominant herbivores in many ecosystems. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR, we characterized the gut microbiomes of wild leaf-feeding caterpillars in the United States and Costa Rica, representing 124 species from 15 families. Compared with other insects and vertebrates assayed using the same methods, the microbes that we detected in caterpillar guts were unusually low-density and variable among individuals. Furthermore, the abundance and composition of leaf-associated microbes were reflected in the feces of caterpillars consuming the same plants. Thus, microbes ingested with food are present (although possibly dead or dormant) in the caterpillar gut, but host-specific, resident symbionts are largely absent. To test whether transient microbes might still contribute to feeding and development, we conducted an experiment on field-collected caterpillars of the model species               Manduca sexta               . Antibiotic suppression of gut bacterial activity did not significantly affect caterpillar weight gain, development, or survival. The high pH, simple gut structure, and fast transit times that typify caterpillar digestive physiology may prevent microbial colonization. Moreover, host-encoded digestive and detoxification mechanisms likely render microbes unnecessary for caterpillar herbivory. Caterpillars illustrate the potential ecological and evolutionary benefits of independence from symbionts, a lifestyle that may be widespread among animals.},

Incomplete and error-filled assemblies result in many annotation errors, especially in the number of genes present in a genome. This means that methods attempting to estimate rates of gene duplication and loss often will be misled by such errors and that rates of gene family evolution will be consistently overestimated. Here, we present a method that takes these errors into account, allowing one to accurately infer rates of gene gain and loss among genomes even with low assembly and annotation quality. The method is implemented in the newest version of the software package CAFE, along with several other novel features. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method with extensive simulations and reanalyze several previously published data sets. Our results show that errors in genome annotation do lead to higher inferred rates of gene gain and loss but that CAFE 3 sufficiently accounts for these errors to provide accurate estimates of important evolutionary parameters.},

The novel peptide consisted of 42 amino acids and was highly basic. This peptide indicated no significant similarity with other antibacterial peptides. The peptide showed antibacterial activity against several Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and had a higher activity against Gram-positive bacteria than cecropin B1, a major antibacterial peptide of B. mori. The novel peptide was inducible by bacterial injection. These results suggest that the peptide is responsible for the antibacterial activity in B. mori against Gram-positive bacteria. The effects of the peptide on bacterial and liposomal membranes showed that a target of the peptide is the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. The results also suggest that the N-terminal portion of the peptide, containing a predicted alpha-helix, is responsible for an increase in the membrane permeability.

@article{harrisRapidEvolutionHuman2017,
	Abstract = {DNA is a remarkably precise medium for copying and storing biological information. This high fidelity results from the action of hundreds of genes involved in replication, proofreading, and damage repair. Evolutionary theory suggests that in such a system, selection has limited ability to remove genetic variants that change mutation rates by small amounts or in specific sequence contexts. Consistent with this, using SNV variation as a proxy for mutational input, we report here that mutational spectra differ substantially among species, human continental groups and even some closely related populations. Close examination of one signal, an increased TCC                                                                        →                                                                  TTC mutation rate in Europeans, indicates a burst of mutations from about 15,000 to 2000 years ago, perhaps due to the appearance, drift, and ultimate elimination of a genetic modifier of mutation rate. Our results suggest that mutation rates can evolve markedly over short evolutionary timescales and suggest the possibility of mapping mutational modifiers.                        ,              DNA is a molecule that contains the information needed to build an organism. This information is stored as a code made up of four chemicals: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Every time a cell divides and copies its DNA, it accidentally introduces `typos' into the code, known as mutations. Most mutations are harmless, but some can cause damage. All cells have ways to proofread DNA, and the more resources are devoted to proofreading, the less mutations occur. Simple organisms such as bacteria use less energy to reduce mutations, because their genomes may tolerate more damage. More complex organisms, from yeast to humans, instead need to proofread their genomes more thoroughly.             Recent research has shown that humans have a lower mutation rate than chimpanzees and gorillas, their closest living relatives. Humans and other apes copy and proofread their DNA with basically the same biological machinery as yeast, which is about a billion years old. Yet, humans and apes have only existed for a small fraction of this time, a few million years. Why then do humans need to replicate and proofread their DNA differently from apes, and could it be that the way mutations arise is still evolving?             Previous research revealed that European people experience more mutations within certain DNA motifs (specifically, the DNA sequences `TCC', `TCT', `CCC' and `ACC') than Africans or East Asians do.             Now, Harris (who conducted the previous research) and Pritchard have compared how various human ethnic groups accumulate mutations and how these processes differ in different groups.             Statistical analysis of the genomes of thousands of people from all over the world did indeed show that the mutation rates of many different three-letter DNA motifs have changed during the past 20,000 years of human evolution. Harris and Pritchard report that when groups of humans left Africa and settled in isolated populations across different continents, each population quickly became better at avoiding mutations in some genomic contexts, but worse in others. This suggests that the risk of passing on harmful mutations to future generations is changing and evolving at an even faster rate than was originally suspected.             The results suggest that every human ethnic group carries specific variants of the genes which ensure that DNA replication and repair are accurate. These differences appear to influence which types of mutations are frequently passed down to future generations. An important next step will be to identify the genetic variants that could be controlling mutational patterns and how they affect human health.},

@article{hatfieldCarboxylesterasesGeneralDetoxifying2016,
	Abstract = {Carboxylesterases (CE) are members of the esterase family of enzymes, and as their name suggests, they are responsible for the hydrolysis of carboxylesters into the corresponding alcohol and carboxylic acid. To date, no endogenous CE substrates have been identified and as such, these proteins are thought to act as a mechanism to detoxify ester-containing xenobiotics. As a consequence, they are expressed in tissues that might be exposed to such agents (lung and gut epithelia, liver, kidney, etc.). CEs demonstrate very broad substrate specificities and can hydrolyze compounds as diverse as cocaine, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), permethrin and irinotecan. In addition, these enzymes are irreversibly inhibited by organophosphates such as Sarin and Tabun. In this overview, we will compare and contrast the two human enzymes that have been characterized, and evaluate the biology of the interaction of these proteins with organophosphates (principally nerve agents).},

@article{hedlundUnravelingWorldLongest2021,
	Abstract = {Insect migration redistributes enormous quantities of biomass, nutrients and species globally. A subset of insect migrants perform extreme long-distance journeys, requiring specialized morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations. The migratory globe skimmer dragonfly (Pantala flavescens) is hypothesized to migrate from India across the Indian Ocean to East Africa in the autumn, with a subsequent generation thought to return to India from East Africa the following spring. Using an energetic flight model and wind trajectory analysis, we evaluate the dynamics of this proposed transoceanic migration, which is considered to be the longest regular non-stop migratory flight when accounting for body size. The energetic flight model suggests that a mixed strategy of gliding and active flapping would allow a globe skimmer to stay airborne for up to 230--286 h, assuming that the metabolic rate of gliding flight is close to that of resting. If engaged in continuous active flapping flight only, the flight time is severely reduced to ∼4 h. Relying only on self-powered flight (combining active flapping and gliding), a globe skimmer could cross the Indian Ocean, but the migration would have to occur where the ocean crossing is shortest, at an exceptionally fast gliding speed and with little headwind. Consequently, we deem this scenario unlikely and suggest that wind assistance is essential for the crossing. The wind trajectory analysis reveals intra- and inter-seasonal differences in availability of favorable tailwinds, with only 15.2\% of simulated migration trajectories successfully reaching land in autumn but 40.9\% in spring, taking on average 127 and 55 h respectively. Thus, there is a pronounced requirement on dragonflies to be able to select favorable winds, especially in autumn. In conclusion, a multi-generational, migratory circuit of the Indian Ocean by the globe skimmer is shown to be achievable, provided that advanced adaptations in physiological endurance, behavior and wind selection ability are present. Given that migration over the Indian Ocean would be heavily dependent on the assistance of favorable winds, occurring during a relatively narrow time window, the proposed flyway is potentially susceptible to disruption, if wind system patterns were to be affected by climatic change.},

@article{heintzmanDistinctPredictiveChromatin2007,
	Abstract = {Eukaryotic gene transcription is accompanied by acetylation and methylation of nucleosomes near promoters, but the locations and roles of histone modifications elsewhere in the genome remain unclear. We determined the chromatin modification states in high resolution along 30 Mb of the human genome and found that active promoters are marked by trimethylation of Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4), whereas enhancers are marked by monomethylation, but not trimethylation, of H3K4. We developed computational algorithms using these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements, predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region. This approach accurately predicted the location and function of independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine transporter SLC22A5 (OCTN2). Our results give insight into the connections between chromatin modifications and transcriptional regulatory activity and provide a new tool for the functional annotation of the human genome.},

The results demonstrate an important role of JH in the regulation of ovarian and colleterial gland development in females, and in the regulation of accessory gland, tubular gland and ejaculatory duct development in males. In addition, the presence of an adult reproductive diapause, characterized by decreased effective juvenile hormone haemolymph titres, is suggested. Evidence for the existence of both adipokinetic and diuretic hormones in the Painted Lady is also presented, as is data indicating that both hormones may be similar or identical to those previously described in Monarch butterflies. Owing to the above results, and the existence of an artificial diet suitable for mass rearing in the laboratory, the Painted Lady appears to be an excellent species for studies on adult lepidopteran neuroendocrinology.},

@article{herreraPredictingRADseqMarker2015,
	Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of reduced representation libraries obtained through digestion with restriction enzymes---generically known as restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq)---is a common strategy to generate genome-wide genotypic and sequence data from eukaryotes. A critical design element of any RAD-seq study is knowledge of the approximate number of genetic markers that can be obtained for a taxon using different restriction enzymes, as this number determines the scope of a project, and ultimately defines its success. This number can only be directly determined if a reference genome sequence is available, or it can be estimated if the genome size and restriction recognition sequence probabilities are known. However, both scenarios are uncommon for nonmodel species. Here, we performed systematic in silico surveys of recognition sequences, for diverse and commonly used type II restriction enzymes across the eukaryotic tree of life. Our observations reveal that recognition sequence frequencies for a given restriction enzyme are strikingly variable among broad eukaryotic taxonomic groups, being largely determined by phylogenetic relatedness. We demonstrate that genome sizes can be predicted from cleavage frequency data obtained with restriction enzymes targeting ``neutral'' elements. Models based on genomic compositions are also effective tools to accurately calculate probabilities of recognition sequences across taxa, and can be applied to species for which reduced representation data are available (including transcriptomes and neutral RAD-seq data sets). The analytical pipeline developed in this study, PredRAD (https://github.com/phrh/ PredRAD), and the resulting databases constitute valuable resources that will help guide the design of any study using RAD-seq or related methods.},

@article{higgsCoevolutionCodonUsage2008,
	Abstract = {The typical number of tRNA genes in bacterial genomes is around 50, but this number varies from under 30 to over 120. We argue that tRNA gene copy numbers evolve in response to translational selection. In rapidly multiplying organisms, the time spent in translation is a limiting factor in cell division; hence, it pays to duplicate tRNA genes, thereby increasing the concentration of tRNA molecules in the cell and speeding up translation. In slowly multiplying organisms, translation time is not a limiting factor, so the overall translational cost is minimized by reducing the tRNAs to only one copy of each required gene. Translational selection also causes a preference for codons that are most rapidly translated by the current tRNAs; hence, codon usage and tRNA gene content will coevolve to a state where each is adapted to the other. We show that there is often more than one stable coevolved state. This explains why different combinations of tRNAs and codon bias can exist for different amino acids in the same organism. We analyze a set of 80 complete bacterial genomes and show that the theory predicts many of the trends that are seen in these data.},

@article{hookMultilayeredTuningDosage2019,
	Abstract = {In species with genetic sex determination, dosage compensation can evolve to equal expression levels of sex-linked and autosomal genes. Current knowledge about dosage compensation has mainly been derived from male-heterogametic (XX/XY) model organisms, whereas less is understood about the process in female-heterogametic systems (ZZ/ZW). In moths and butterflies, downregulation of Z-linked expression in males (ZZ) to match the expression level in females (ZW) is often observed. However, little is known about the underlying regulatory mechanisms, or if dosage compensation patterns vary across ontogenetic stages. In this study, we assessed dynamics of Z-linked and autosomal expression levels across developmental stages in the wood white (Leptidea sinapis). We found that although expression of Z-linked genes in general was reduced compared with autosomal genes, dosage compensation was actually complete for some categories of genes, in particular sex-biased genes, but equalization in females was constrained to a narrower gene set. We also observed a noticeable convergence in Z-linked expression between males and females after correcting for sex-biased genes. Sex-biased expression increased successively across developmental stages, and male-biased genes were enriched on the Z-chromosome. Finally, all five core genes associated with the ribonucleoprotein dosage compensation complex male-specific lethal were detected in adult females, in correspondence with a reduction in the expression difference between autosomes and the single Z-chromosome. We show that tuning of gene dosage is multilayered in Lepidoptera and argue that expression balance across chromosomal classes may predominantly be driven by enrichment of male-biased genes on the Z-chromosome and cooption of available dosage regulators.},

@article{huangUDPglucosyltransferaseMultigeneFamily2008,
	Abstract = {Background Glucosidation plays a major role in the inactivation and excretion of a great variety of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. A class of UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is involved in this process. Insect UGTs play important roles in several processes, including detoxication of substrates such as plant allelochemicals, cuticle formation, pigmentation, and olfaction. Identification and characterization of Bombyx mori UGT genes could provide valuable basic information for this important family and explain the detoxication mechanism and other processes in insects. Results Taking advantage of the newly assembled genome sequence, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the candidate UGT family in the silkworm, B. mori. Based on UGT signature and their similarity to UGT homologs from other organisms, we identified 42 putative silkworm UGT genes. Most of them are clustered on the silkworm chromosomes, with two major clusters on chromosomes 7 and 28, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of these identified 42 UGT protein sequences revealed five major groups. A comparison of the silkworm UGTs with homologs from other sequenced insect genomes indicated that some UGTs are silkworm-specific genes. The expression patterns of these candidate genes were investigated with known expressed sequence tags (ESTs), microarray data, and RT-PCR method. In total, 36 genes were expressed in tissues examined and showed different patterns of expression profile, indicating that these UGT genes might have different functions. Conclusion B. mori possesses a largest insect UGT gene family characterized to date, including 42 genes. Phylogenetic analysis, genomic organization and expression profiles provide an overview for the silkworm UGTs and facilitate their functional studies in future.},

	Abstract = {eggNOG is a public database of orthology relationships, gene evolutionary histories and functional annotations. Here, we present version 5.0, featuring a major update of the underlying genome sets, which have been expanded to 4445 representative bacteria and 168 archaea derived from 25 038 genomes, as well as 477 eukaryotic organisms and 2502 viral proteomes that were selected for diversity and filtered by genome quality. In total, 4.4M orthologous groups (OGs) distributed across 379 taxonomic levels were computed together with their associated sequence alignments, phylogenies, HMM models and functional descriptors. Precomputed evolutionary analysis provides fine-grained resolution of duplication/speciation events within each OG. Our benchmarks show that, despite doubling the amount of genomes, the quality of orthology assignments and functional annotations (80\% coverage) has persisted without significant changes across this update. Finally, we improved eggNOG online services for fast functional annotation and orthology prediction of custom genomics or metagenomics datasets.

@article{HumanSMC5Complex2006,
	Abstract = {The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins has been implicated in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR). The SMC1/3 cohesin complex is thought to promote HR by maintaining the close proximity of sister chromatids at DSBs. The SMC5/6 complex is also required for DNA repair, but the mechanism by which it accomplishes this is unclear. Here, we show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the SMC5/6 complex components in human cells increases the efficiency of gene targeting due to a specific requirement for hSMC5/6 in sister chromatid HR. Knockdown of the hSMC5/6 complex decreases sister chromatid HR, but does not reduce nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or intra-chromatid, homologue, or extrachromosomal HR. The hSMC5/6 complex is itself recruited to nuclease-induced DSBs and is required for the recruitment of cohesin to DSBs. Our results establish a mechanism by which the hSMC5/6 complex promotes DNA repair and suggest a novel strategy to improve the efficiency of gene targeting in mammalian somatic cells.},

@article{janzBUTTERFLIESPLANTSPHYLOGENETIC1998,
	Abstract = {A database on host plant records from 437 ingroup taxa has been used to test a number of hypotheses on the interaction between butterflies and their host plants using phylogenetic methods (simple character optimization, concentrated changes test, and independent contrasts test). The butterfly phylogeny was assembled from various sources and host plant clades were identified according to Chase et al. 's rbcL-based phylogeny. The ancestral host plant appears to be associated within a highly derived rosid clade, including the family Fabaceae. As fossil data suggest that this clade is older than the butterflies, they must have colonized already diversified plants. Previous studies also suggest that the patterns of association in most insect-plant interactions are more shaped by host shifts, through colonization and specialization, than by cospeciation. Consequently, we have focused explicitly on the mechanisms behind host shifts. Our results confirm, in the light of new phylogenetic evidence, the pattern reported by Ehrlich and Raven that related butterflies feed on related plants. We show that host shifts have generally been more common between closely related plants than between more distantly related plants. This finding, together with the possibility of a higher tendency of recolonizing ancestral hosts, helps to explain the apparent large-scale conservation in the patterns of association between insects and their host plants, patterns which at the same time are more flexible on a more detailed level. Plant growth form was an even more conservative aspect of the interaction between butterflies and their host plants than plant phylogeny. However, this is largely explained by a higher probability of colonizations and host shifts while feeding on trees than on other growth forms.},

@article{janzEhrlichRavenRevisited2011,
	Abstract = {After almost 50 years of scrutiny, the ideas that Ehrlich and Raven presented in their classical paper on the coevolution between butterflies and plants are still very much alive. Much of this interest has involved the potential for codiversification, both in how the interaction itself diversifies and how the interaction affects modes and rates of speciation. Despite high levels of conservatism and specialization, diversification of the interaction appears to be mainly a consequence of host shifts, but this somewhat paradoxical conclusion can be understood by an appreciation of the ecological as well as genetic mechanisms behind host shifts. There are several ways that the interaction can influence speciation, with or without host-plant-based divergent selection on reproductive barriers. One current debate is over the relative importance of radiations following shifts to new adaptive zones and elevated rates of speciation in groups with plastic and diverse host use.},

@article{jigginsGeneticLinkageMap2005,
	Abstract = {Heliconius melpomene is a mimetic butterfly that exhibits great geographic variation in color pattern. We present here a genetic linkage map based on analysis of genetic markers in 73 individuals from a single F2 family, offspring of a cross between H. m. cythera from western Ecuador and H. m. melpomene from French Guiana. A novel ``three-step method'' is described for the analysis of dominant markers in an F2 cross, using outbred parental strains and taking advantage of the lack of crossing over in female Lepidoptera. This method is likely to prove useful for future mapping studies in outbred species with crossing over restricted to one sex, such as the Lepidoptera and Drosophila. The resulting linkage map has 21 linkage groups corresponding to the 21 chromosomes of H. melpomene and includes 219 AFLP markers, 23 microsatellites, 19 single-copy nuclear genes, and the color pattern switch genes Yb and Sb. The marker density is high, averaging {$>$}1/7 cM. The total map length is 1616 cM and the average chromosome length is 77 cM. The genome size of H. melpomene was estimated to be 292 Mb, giving a relationship of physical-to-map distance of 180 kb/cM. This map forms the basis for future comparative linkage analysis of color pattern evolution in Heliconius.},

@article{jinGenomewideVariabilityRecombination2021,
	Abstract = {Recombination enables reciprocal exchange of genomic information between parental chromosomes and successful segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Errors in this process lead to negative health outcomes, whereas variability in recombination rate affects genome evolution. In mammals, most crossovers occur in hotspots defined by PRDM9 motifs, although PRDM9 binding peaks are not all equally hot. We hypothesize that dynamic patterns of meiotic genome folding are linked to recombination activity. We apply an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze how three-dimensional (3D) chromosomal organization during meiosis relates to rates of double-strand-break (DSB) and crossover (CO) formation at PRDM9 binding peaks. We show that active, spatially accessible genomic regions during meiotic prophase are associated with DSB-favored loci, which further adopt a transient locally active configuration in early prophase. Conversely, crossover formation is depleted among DSBs in spatially accessible regions during meiotic prophase, particularly within gene bodies. We also find evidence that active chromatin regions have smaller average loop sizes in mammalian meiosis. Collectively, these findings establish that differences in chromatin architecture along chromosomal axes are associated with variable recombination activity. We propose an updated framework describing how 3D organization of brush-loop chromosomes during meiosis may modulate recombination.},

@article{katjuStructureEarlyEvolution2003,
	Abstract = {The significance of gene duplication in provisioning raw materials for the evolution of genomic diversity is widely recognized, but the early evolutionary dynamics of duplicate genes remain obscure. To elucidate the structural characteristics of newly arisen gene duplicates at infancy and their subsequent evolutionary properties, we analyzed gene pairs with Յ10\% divergence at synonymous sites within the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans. Structural heterogeneity between duplicate copies is present very early in their evolutionary history and is maintained over longer evolutionary timescales, suggesting that duplications across gene boundaries in conjunction with shuffling events have at least as much potential to contribute to long-term evolution as do fully redundant (complete) duplicates. The median duplication span of 1.4 kb falls short of the average gene length in C. elegans (2.5 kb), suggesting that partial gene duplications are frequent. Most gene duplicates reside close to the parent copy at inception, often as tandem inverted loci, and appear to disperse in the genome as they age, as a result of reduced survivorship of duplicates located in proximity to the ancestral copy. We propose that illegitimate recombination events leading to inverted duplications play a disproportionately large role in gene duplication within this genome in comparison with other mechanisms.},

@article{kawakamiHighdensityLinkageMap2014,
	Abstract = {Detailed linkage and recombination rate maps are necessary to use the full potential of genome sequencing and population genomic analyses. We used a custom collared flycatcher 50 K SNP array to develop a high-density linkage map with 37 262 markers assigned to 34 linkage groups in 33 autosomes and the Z chromosome. The best-order map contained 4215 markers, with a total distance of 3132 cM and a mean genetic distance between markers of 0.12 cM. Facilitated by the array being designed to include markers from most scaffolds, we obtained a second-generation assembly of the flycatcher genome that approaches full chromosome sequences (N50 super-scaffold size 20.2 Mb and with 1.042 Gb (of 1.116 Gb) anchored to and mostly ordered and oriented along chromosomes). We found that flycatcher and zebra finch chromosomes are entirely syntenic but that inversions at mean rates of 1.5--2.0 event (6.6--7.5 Mb) per My have changed the organization within chromosomes, rates high enough for inversions to potentially have been involved with many speciation events during avian evolution. The mean recombination rate was 3.1 cM/Mb and correlated closely with chromosome size, from 2 cM/Mb for chromosomes {$>$}100 Mb to {$>$}10 cM/Mb for chromosomes {$<$}10 Mb. This size dependence seemed entirely due to an obligate recombination event per chromosome; if 50 cM was subtracted from the genetic lengths of chromosomes, the rate per physical unit DNA was constant across chromosomes. Flycatcher recombination rate showed similar variation along chromosomes as chicken but lacked the large interior recombination deserts characteristic of zebra finch chromosomes.},

@article{kazemianEvidenceDeepRegulatory2014,
	Abstract = {Many genes familiar from Drosophila development, such as the so-called gap, pair-rule, and segment polarity genes, play important roles in the development of other insects and in many cases appear to be deployed in a similar fashion, despite the fact that Drosophila-like ``long germband'' development is highly derived and confined to a subset of insect families. Whether or not these similarities extend to the regulatory level is unknown. Identification of regulatory regions beyond the well-studied Drosophila has been challenging as even within the Diptera (flies, including mosquitoes) regulatory sequences have diverged past the point of recognition by standard alignment methods. Here, we demonstrate that methods we previously developed for computational cis-regulatory module (CRM) discovery in Drosophila can be used effectively in highly diverged (250--350 Myr) insect species including Anopheles gambiae, Tribolium castaneum, Apis mellifera, and Nasonia vitripennis. In Drosophila, we have successfully used small sets of known CRMs as ``training data'' to guide the search for other CRMs with related function. We show here that although species-specific CRM training data do not exist, training sets from Drosophila can facilitate CRM discovery in diverged insects. We validate in vivo over a dozen new CRMs, roughly doubling the number of known CRMs in the four non-Drosophila species. Given the growing wealth of Drosophila CRM annotation, these results suggest that extensive regulatory sequence annotation will be possible in newly sequenced insects without recourse to costly and labor-intensive genome-scale experiments. We develop a new method, Regulus, which computes a probabilistic score of similarity based on binding site composition (despite the absence of nucleotide-level sequence alignment), and demonstrate similarity between functionally related CRMs from orthologous loci. Our work represents an important step toward being able to trace the evolutionary history of gene regulatory networks and defining the mechanisms underlying insect evolution.},

@article{kentCoevolutionTransposableElements2017,
	Abstract = {One of the most striking patterns of genome structure is the tight, typically negative, association between transposable elements (TEs) and meiotic recombination rates. While this is a highly recurring feature of eukaryotic genomes, the mechanisms driving correlations between TEs and recombination remain poorly understood, and distinguishing cause versus effect is challenging. Here, we review the evidence for a relation between TEs and recombination, and discuss the underlying evolutionary forces. Evidence to date suggests that overall TE densities correlate negatively with recombination, but the strength of this correlation varies across element types, and the pattern can be reversed. Results suggest that heterogeneity in the strength of selection against ectopic recombination and gene disruption can drive TE accumulation in regions of low recombination, but there is also strong evidence that the regulation of TEs can influence local recombination rates. We hypothesize that TE insertion polymorphism may be important in driving within-species variation in recombination rates in surrounding genomic regions. Furthermore, the interaction between TEs and recombination may create positive feedback, whereby TE accumulation in non-recombining regions contributes to the spread of recombination suppression. Further investigation of the coevolution between recombination and TEs has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of recombination rates and genome structure. This article is part of the themed issue `Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation in sexual organisms'.},

@article{kochNovoMutationRate2019,
	Abstract = {Knowledge of mutation rates is crucial for calibrating population genetics models of demographic history in units of years. However, mutation rates remain challenging to estimate because of the need to identify extremely rare events. We estimated the nuclear mutation rate in wolves by identifying de novo mutations in a pedigree of seven wolves. Putative de novo mutations were discovered by whole-genome sequencing and were verified by Sanger sequencing of parents and offspring. Using stringent filters and an estimate of the false negative rate in the remaining observable genome, we obtain an estimate of \$4.5 {\^A} 10{\`A}9 per base pair per generation and provide conservative bounds between 2.6 {\^A} 10{\`A}9 and 7.1 {\^A} 10{\`A}9. Although our estimate is consistent with recent mutation rate estimates from ancient DNA (4.0 {\^A} 10{\`A}9 and 3.0--4.5 {\^A} 10{\`A}9), it suggests a wider possible range. We also examined the consequences of our rate and the accompanying interval for dating several critical events in canid demographic history. For example, applying our full range of rates to coalescent models of dog and wolf demographic history implies a wide set of possible divergence times between the ancestral populations of dogs and extant Eurasian wolves (16,000--64,000 years ago) although our point estimate indicates a date between 25,000 and 33,000 years ago. Aside from one study in mice, ours provides the only direct mammalian mutation rate outside of primates and is likely to be vital to future investigations of mutation rate evolution. Key words: demographic history, mutation rate, dog domestication.},

@article{kondrashovGeneDuplicationMechanism2012,
	Abstract = {A subject of extensive study in evolutionary theory has been the issue of how neutral, redundant copies can be maintained in the genome for long periods of time. Concurrently, examples of adaptive gene duplications to various environmental conditions in different species have been described. At this point, it is too early to tell whether or not a substantial fraction of gene copies have initially achieved fixation by positive selection for increased dosage. Nevertheless, enough examples have accumulated in the literature that such a possibility should be considered. Here, I review the recent examples of adaptive gene duplications and make an attempt to draw generalizations on what types of genes may be particularly prone to be selected for under certain environmental conditions. The identification of copy-number variation in ecological field studies of species adapting to stressful or novel environmental conditions may improve our understanding of gene duplications as a mechanism of adaptation and its relevance to the long-term persistence of gene duplications.},

	Abstract = {The color patterns of African cichlid fishes provide notable examples of phenotypic convergence. Across the more than 1200 East African rift lake species, melanic horizontal stripes have evolved numerous times. We discovered that regulatory changes of the gene               agouti-related peptide 2               (               agrp2               ) act as molecular switches controlling this evolutionarily labile phenotype. Reduced               agrp2               expression is convergently associated with the presence of stripe patterns across species flocks. However, cis-regulatory mutations are not predictive of stripes across radiations, suggesting independent regulatory mechanisms. Genetic mapping confirms the link between the               agrp2               locus and stripe patterns. The crucial role of               agrp2               is further supported by a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout that reconstitutes stripes in a nonstriped cichlid. Thus, we unveil how a single gene affects the convergent evolution of a complex color pattern.},

Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text.

@article{landysMetabolicProfileLongdistance2005,
	Abstract = {Migrating birds often complete long non-stop flights during which body energy stores exclusively support energetic demands. The metabolic correlates of such long-distance travel in free-living migrants are as yet poorly studied. Bar-tailed godwits, Limosa lapponica taymyrensis, undertake a 4500 km flight to their single spring stopover site and thus provide an excellent model in which to determine the energy fuels associated with endurance travel. To this end, we evaluated plasma concentrations of six key metabolites in arriving godwits caught immediately upon landing near their stopover site. Initial metabolite levels were compared with levels after 5 h of inactive rest to determine how flight per se affects energy metabolism. Birds refuelling on the stopover site were also examined. Arriving godwits displayed elevated plasma free fatty acids, glycerol and butyrate, confirming the importance of lipid fuel in the support of extended migratory activity. Furthermore, elevated plasma triglycerides in these birds suggest that fatty acid provisioning is facilitated through hepatic synthesis and release of neutral lipids, as previously hypothesized for small migrants with high mass-specific metabolic rates. Finally, elevations in plasma uric acid suggest that protein breakdown contributes to the support of long-distance movement, to possibly maintain citric acid cycle intermediates, gluconeogenesis and/or water balance.},

@article{leeDNAReplicationMechanism2007,
	Abstract = {The prevailing mechanism for recurrent and some nonrecurrent rearrangements causing genomic disorders is nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between region-specific low-copy repeats (LCRs). For other nonrecurrent rearrangements, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is implicated. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked dysmyelinating disorder caused most frequently (60\%--70\%) by nonrecurrent duplication of the dosage-sensitive proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene but also by nonrecurrent deletion or point mutations. Many PLP1 duplication junctions are refractory to breakpoint sequence analysis, an observation inconsistent with a simple recombination mechanism. Our current analysis of junction sequences in PMD patients confirms the occurrence of simple tandem PLP1 duplications but also uncovers evidence for sequence complexity at some junctions. These data are consistent with a replication-based mechanism that we term FoSTeS, for replication Fork Stalling and Template Switching. We propose that complex duplication and deletion rearrangements associated with PMD, and potentially other nonrecurrent rearrangements, may be explained by this replication-based mechanism.},

@article{lenormandEvolutionRecombinationHeterogeneous2000,
	Abstract = {Most models describing the evolution of recombination have focused on the case of a single population, implicitly assuming that all individuals are equally likely to mate and that spatial heterogeneity in selection is absent. In these models, the evolution of recombination is driven by linkage disequilibria generated either by epistatic selection or drift. Models based on epistatic selection show that recombination can be favored if epistasis is negative and weak compared to directional selection and if the recombination modifier locus is tightly linked to the selected loci. In this article, we examine the joint effects of spatial heterogeneity in selection and epistasis on the evolution of recombination. In a model with two patches, each subject to different selection regimes, we consider the cases of mutation-selection and migration-selection balance as well as the spread of beneficial alleles. We find that including spatial heterogeneity extends the range of epistasis over which recombination can be favored. Indeed, recombination can be favored without epistasis, with negative and even with positive epistasis depending on environmental circumstances. The selection pressure acting on recombination-modifier loci is often much stronger with spatial heterogeneity, and even loosely linked modifiers and free linkage may evolve. In each case, predicting whether recombination is favored requires knowledge of both the type of environmental heterogeneity and epistasis, as none of these factors alone is sufficient to predict the outcome.},

Here, we characterize the evolution of regulatory loci in butterflies and moths using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) annotation of regulatory elements across three stages of head development. In the process we provide a high-quality, functionally annotated genome assembly for the butterfly, Heliconius erato. Comparing cis-regulatory element conservation across six lepidopteran genomes, we find that regulatory sequences evolve at a pace similar to that of protein-coding regions. We also observe that elements active at multiple developmental stages are markedly more conserved than elements with stage-specific activity. Surprisingly, we also find that stage-specific proximal and distal regulatory elements evolve at nearly identical rates. Our study provides a benchmark for genome-wide patterns of regulatory element evolution in insects, and it shows that developmental timing of activity strongly predicts patterns of regulatory sequence evolution.},

@article{lewisDryasIuliaGenome2021,
	Abstract = {In butterflies and moths, which exhibit highly variable sex determination mechanisms, the homogametic Z chromosome is deeply conserved and is featured in many genome assemblies. The evolution and origin of the female W sex chromosome, however, remains mostly unknown. Previous studies have proposed that a ZZ/Z0 sex determination system is ancestral to Lepidoptera, and that W chromosomes may originate from sex-linked B chromosomes. Here, we sequence and assemble the female Dryas iulia genome into 32 highly contiguous ordered and oriented chromosomes, including the Z and W sex chromosomes. We then use sex-specific Hi-C, ATAC-seq, PRO-seq, and whole-genome DNA sequence data sets to test if features of the D. iulia W chromosome are consistent with a hypothesized B chromosome origin. We show that the putative W chromosome displays female-associated DNA sequence, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility to confirm the sex-linked function of the W sequence. In contrast with expectations from studies of homologous sex chromosomes, highly repetitive DNA content on the W chromosome, the sole presence of domesticated repetitive elements in functional DNA, and lack of sequence homology with the Z chromosome or autosomes is most consistent with a B chromosome origin for the W, although it remains challenging to rule out extensive sequence divergence. Synteny analysis of the D. iulia W chromosome with other female lepidopteran genome assemblies shows no homology between W chromosomes and suggests multiple, independent origins of the W chromosome from a B chromosome likely occurred in butterflies.},

@article{lewisGenomeWideRegulatoryAdaptation2019,
	Abstract = {Cis-regulatory evolution is an important engine of organismal diversification. Although recent studies have looked at genomic patterns of regulatory evolution between species, we still have a poor understanding of the magnitude and nature of regulatory variation within species. Here, we examine the evolution of regulatory element activity over wing development in three Heliconius erato butterfly populations to determine how regulatory variation is associated with population structure. We show that intraspecific divergence in chromatin accessibility and regulatory activity is abundant, and that regulatory variants are spatially clustered in the genome. Regions with strong population structure are highly enriched for regulatory variants, and enrichment patterns are associated with developmental stage and gene expression. We also found that variable regulatory elements are particularly enriched in species-specific genomic regions and long interspersed nuclear elements. Our findings suggest that genome-wide selection on chromatin accessibility and regulatory activity is an important force driving patterns of genomic divergence within Heliconius species. This work also provides a resource for the study of gene regulatory evolution in H. erato and other heliconiine butterflies.},

	Abstract = {Characterizing the genetic complexity of adaptation and trait evolution is a major emphasis of evolutionary biology and genetics. Incongruent findings from genetic studies have resulted in conceptual models ranging from a few large-effect loci to massively polygenic architectures. Here, we combine chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, Hi-C, RNA sequencing, and 40 whole-genome sequences from               Heliconius               butterflies to show that red color pattern diversification occurred via many genomic loci. We find that the red wing pattern master regulatory transcription factor Optix binds dozens of loci also under selection, which frequently form three-dimensional adaptive hubs with selection acting on multiple physically interacting genes. Many Optix-bound genes under selection are tied to pigmentation and wing development, and these loci collectively maintain separation between adaptive red color pattern phenotypes in natural populations. We propose a model of trait evolution where functional connections between loci may resolve much of the disparity between large-effect and polygenic evolutionary models.},

	Abstract = {Color pattern mimicry in               Heliconius               butterflies is a classic case study of complex trait adaptation via selection on a few large effect genes. Association studies have linked color pattern variation to a handful of noncoding regions, yet the presumptive cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that control color patterning remain unknown. Here we combine chromatin assays, DNA sequence associations, and genome editing to functionally characterize 5 cis-regulatory elements of the color pattern gene               optix               . We were surprised to find that the cis-regulatory architecture of               optix               is characterized by pleiotropy and regulatory fragility, where deletion of individual cis-regulatory elements has broad effects on both color pattern and wing vein development. Remarkably, we found orthologous cis-regulatory elements associate with wing pattern convergence of distantly related comimics, suggesting that parallel coevolution of ancestral elements facilitated pattern mimicry. Our results support a model of color pattern evolution in               Heliconius               where changes to ancient, multifunctional cis-regulatory elements underlie adaptive radiation.},

@article{liaoTopologicallyAssociatingDomains2021,
	Abstract = {Topologically associating domains (TADs) were recently identified as fundamental units of three-dimensional eukaryotic genomic organization, although our knowledge of the influence of TADs on genome evolution remains preliminary. To study the molecular evolution of TADs in Drosophila species, we constructed a new reference-grade genome assembly and accompanying high-resolution TAD map for D. pseudoobscura. Comparison of D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster, which are separated by ∼49 million years of divergence, showed that ∼30\%--40\% of their genomes retain conserved TADs. Comparative genomic analysis of 17 Drosophila species revealed that chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints are enriched at TAD boundaries but depleted within TADs. Additionally, genes within conserved TADs show lower expression divergence than those located in nonconserved TADs. Furthermore, we found that a substantial proportion of long genes ({$>$}50 kbp) in D. melanogaster (42\%) and D. pseudoobscura (26\%) constitute their own TADs, implying transcript structure may be one of the deterministic factors for TAD formation. By using structural variants (SVs) identified from 14 D. melanogaster strains, its three closest sibling species from the D. simulans species complex, and two obscura clade species, we uncovered evidence of selection acting on SVs at TAD boundaries, but with the nature of selection differing between SV types. Deletions are depleted at TAD boundaries in both divergent and polymorphic SVs, suggesting purifying selection, whereas divergent tandem duplications are enriched at TAD boundaries relative to polymorphism, suggesting they are adaptive. Our findings highlight how important TADs are in shaping the acquisition and retention of structural mutations that fundamentally alter genome organization.},

Studying complete genome data from closely related species allows accurate estimation of gene family turnover rates.

A significant proportion of the phenotypic variance in migratory traits is genetic, but the genes involved in shaping these phenotypes are still unknown. Although recent achievements in genomics will evolve migratory genetics research from a phenotypic to a molecular approach, fully sequenced and annotated genomes of migratory species are still lacking. Consequently, many of the genes involved in migration are unavailable as candidates. Migration is central to the life-history adaptations of many animals. Here, we review current understanding of the genetic architecture of migratory traits and discuss the significant implications this will have for other areas of biology, including population responses to climate change, speciation and conservation management.},

	Abstract = {Gene and genome duplications are the primary source of new genes and novel functions and have played a pivotal role in the evolution of genomic and organismal complexity [, ]. The spontaneous rate of gene duplication is a critical parameter for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of gene duplicates; yet few direct empirical estimates exist and differ widely. The presence of a large population of recently derived gene duplicates in sequenced genomes suggests a high rate of spontaneous origin, also evidenced by population-genomic studies reporting rampant copy-number polymorphism at the intraspecific level [--]. An analysis of long-term mutation-accumulation lines of Caenorhabditis elegans for gene copy-number changes using array Comparative Genomic Hybridization yields the first direct estimate of the genome-wide rate of gene duplication in a multicellular eukaryote. The gene duplication rate in C. elegans is quite high, on the order of 10−7 duplications/gene/generation. This rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the spontaneous rate of point mutation per nucleotide site in this species and also greatly exceeds an earlier estimate derived from the frequency distribution of extant gene duplicates in the sequenced C. elegans genome.},

However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty. RESULTS: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

	Abstract = {An accurate and high-resolution genetic map is critical for mapping complex traits, yet the resolution of the current rat genetic map is far lower than human and mouse, and has not been updated since the original Jensen-Seaman map in 2004. For the first time, we have refined the rat genetic map to sub-centimorgan (cM) resolution ({$<$}0.02 cM) by using 95,769 genetic markers and 870 informative meioses from a cohort of 528 heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. Global recombination rates in the revised sex-averaged map (0.66 cM/Mb) did not differ compared to the historical map (0.65 cM/Mb); however, substantial refinement was made to the localization of highly recombinant regions within the revised map. Also for the first time, sex-specific rat genetic maps were generated, which revealed both genomewide and fine-scale variation in recombination rates between male and female rats. Reanalysis of multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) using the historical and refined rat genetic maps demonstrated marked changes to QTL localization, shape, and effect size. As a resource to the rat research community, we have provided revised centimorgan positions for all physical positions within the rat genome and commonly used genetic markers for trait mapping, including 44,828 SSLP markers and the RATDIV genotyping array. Collectively, this study provides a substantial improvement to the rat genetic map and an unprecedented resource for analysis of complex traits and recombination in the rat.},

	Abstract = {The genetic code is degenerate, and most amino acids are encoded by two to six synonymous codons. Codon usage bias, the preference for certain synonymous codons, is a universal feature of all genomes examined. Synonymous codon mutations were previously thought to be silent; however, a growing body evidence now shows that codon usage regulates protein structure and gene expression through effects on co-translational protein folding, translation efficiency and accuracy, mRNA stability, and transcription. Codon usage regulates the speed of translation elongation, resulting in non-uniform ribosome decoding rates on mRNAs during translation that is adapted to co-translational protein folding~process. Biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrate that codon usage plays an important role in regulating protein folding and function in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Certain protein structural types are more sensitive than others to the effects of codon usage on protein folding, and predicted intrinsically disordered domains are more prone to misfolding caused by codon usage changes than other domain types. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that gene codon usage correlates with different protein structures in diverse organisms, indicating the existence of a codon usage code for co-translational protein folding. This review focuses on recent literature on the role and mechanism of codon usage in regulating translation kinetics and co-translational protein folding.},

@article{liuGenomeSizeVariation2020,
	Abstract = {Butterflies have been of great interest to naturalists for centuries, and the study of butterflies has been an integral part of ecology and evolution ever since Darwin proposed his theory of natural selection in 1859. There are {$>$} 18 000 butterfly species worldwide, showing great diversity in morphological traits and ecological niches. Compared with butterfly diversity, however, patterns of genome size variation in butterflies remain poorly understood, especially in a phylogenetic context. Here, we sequenced and assembled the mitogenomes of 68 butterflies and measured the genome sizes (C-values) of 67 of them. We also assembled 10 mitogenomes using reads from GenBank. Among the assembled 78 mitogenomes, those from 59 species, 23 genera and one subfamily are reported for the first time. Combining with published data of mitogenomes and genome size, we explored the patterns in genome size variation for 106 butterfly species in a phylogenetic context based on analyses of mitogenomes from 264 species covering six families. Our results show that the genome size of butterflies has a 6.4-fold variation ranging from 0.203 pg (199 Mb) (Nymphalidae: Heliconius xanthocles) to 1.287 pg (1253 Mb) (Papilionidae: Parnassius orleans). Within families, the largest variation was found in Papilionidae (5.9-fold: 0.22--1.29 pg), followed by Nymphalidae (4.8-fold: 0.2--0.95 pg), Pieridae (4.4-fold: 0.22--0.97 pg), Hesperiidae (2.2-fold: 0.3--0.66 pg), Lycaenidae (2.6-fold: 0.39--1.02 pg) and Rioidinidae (1.8-fold: 0.48--0.87 pg). Our data also suggest that butterflies have an ancestral genome size of c. 0.5 pg, and some ancestral genome size increase or decrease events along different subfamilies or tribes produce the diversity of genome size variation in diverse butterflies. Our data provide novel insights into patterns of genome size variation in butterflies and are an important reference for future genome sequencing programmes.},

	Abstract = {The Chinese oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi, is an economically important insect of the Saturniidae family. In this study, genome walking was performed to obtain an A. pernyi actin promoter, which can be employed in transgenic or stable cell line expression systems. The putative promoter was analyzed by the online promoter analysis programs at the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and the Web Promoter Scan Service, which led to the recognition of several functional elements. With respect to these elements, a series of actin A1 promoter fragments with 50-deletions were generated that were then used to construct different vectors expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). The plasmids were transfected into Sf9 cells and GFP expression was determined by observing GFP fluorescence in cells and by measuring GFP mRNA levels with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Sequence comparisons indicated that the sequence cloned from A. pernyi was the actin A1 promoter. The basic function of the promoter was verified by constructing expression vectors and observing GFP expression. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed a strong inhibitory element may exist upstream of the TATA box, which downregulated gene expression. The actin A1 promoter is an ideal candidate for use in A. pernyi transgenic systems.},

@article{loehlinExpressionTandemGene2016,
	Abstract = {Tandem gene duplication is an important mutational process in evolutionary adaptation and human disease. Hypothetically, two tandem gene copies should produce twice the output of a single gene, but this expectation has not been rigorously investigated. Here, we show that tandem duplication often results in more than double the gene activity. A naturally occurring tandem duplication of the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene exhibits 2.6-fold greater expression than the single-copy gene in transgenic Drosophila. This tandem duplication also exhibits greater activity than two copies of the gene in trans, demonstrating that it is the tandem arrangement and not copy number that is the cause of overactivity. We also show that tandem duplication of an unrelated synthetic reporter gene is overactive (2.3- to 5.1-fold) at all sites in the genome that we tested, suggesting that overactivity could be a general property of tandem gene duplicates. Overactivity occurs at the level of RNA transcription, and therefore tandem duplicate overactivity appears to be a previously unidentified form of position effect. The increment of surplus gene expression observed is comparable to many regulatory mutations fixed in nature and, if typical of other genomes, would shape the fate of tandem duplicates in evolution.},

@article{flynn_repeatmodeler2_2020,
	Abstract = {Significance
            Genome sequences are being produced for more and more eukaryotic species. The bulk of these genomes are composed of parasitic, self-mobilizing transposable elements (TEs) that play important roles in organismal evolution. Thus there is a pressing need for developing software that can accurately identify the diverse set of TEs dispersed in genome sequences. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, an easy-to-use package for the production of reference TE libraries which can be applied to any eukaryotic species. Through several major improvements over the previous version, RepeatModeler2 is able to produce libraries that recapitulate the known composition of three model species with some of the most complex TE landscapes. Thus RepeatModeler2 will greatly enhance the discovery and annotation of TEs in genome sequences.
          , 
            
              The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components such as transposable elements (TEs). Because the types and sequences of TEs are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all of the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, a pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This program brings substantial improvements over the original version of RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated TE libraries:
              Drosophila melanogaster
              (fruit fly),
              Danio rerio
              (zebrafish), and
              Oryza sativa
              (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified approximately 3 times more consensus sequences matching with {\textgreater}95\% sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is for LTR retroelements. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences.

	Abstract = {The evolution of intrinsic barriers to gene flow is a crucial step in the process of speciation. Chromosomal changes caused by fusion and fission events are one such barrier and are common in several groups of Lepidoptera. However, it remains unclear if and how chromosomal changes have contributed to speciation in this group. I tested for a phylogenetic signal of varying chromosome numbers in Erebia butterflies by combining existing sequence data with karyological information. I also compared different models of trait evolution in order to infer the underlying evolutionary mechanisms. Overall, I found significant phylogenetic signals that are consistent with non-neutral trait evolution only when parts of the mitochondrial genome were included, suggesting cytonuclear discordances. The adaptive evolutionary model tested in this study consistently outperformed the neutral model of trait evolution. Taken together, these results suggest that, unlike other Lepidoptera groups, changes in chromosome numbers may have played a role in the diversification of Erebia butterflies.},

	Abstract = {The blue butterfly species Polyommatus (Plebicula) atlanticus (Elwes, 1906) (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae) is known to have a very high haploid number of chromosomes (n= circa 223). However, this approximate count made by Hugo de Lesse 45 years ago was based on analysis of a single meiotic I metaphase plate, not confirmed by study of diploid chromosome set and not documented by microphotographs. Here I demonstrate that (1) P. atlanticus is a diploid (non-polyploid) species, (2) its meiotic I chromosome complement includes at least 224-226 countable chromosome bodies, and (3) all (or nearly all) chromosome elements in meiotic I karyotype are represented by bivalents. I also provide the first data on the diploid karyotype and estimate the diploid chromosome number as 2n=ca448-452. Thus, P. atlanticus is confirmed to possess the highest chromosome number among all the non-polyploid eukaryotic organisms.},

@article{lukhtanovVersatilityMultivalentOrientation2018,
	Abstract = {Chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., fusions/fissions) have the potential to drive speciation. However, their accumulation in a population is generally viewed as unlikely, because chromosomal heterozygosity should lead to meiotic problems and aneuploid gametes. Canonical meiosis involves segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and sister chromatid segregation during meiosis II. In organisms with holocentric chromosomes, which are characterized by kinetic activity distributed along almost the entire chromosome length, this order may be inverted depending on their metaphase I orientation. Here we analyzed the evolutionary role of this intrinsic versatility of holocentric chromosomes, which is not available to monocentric ones, by studying F               1               to F               4               hybrids between two chromosomal races of the Wood White butterfly (               Leptidea sinapis               ), separated by at least 24 chromosomal fusions/fissions. We found that these chromosomal rearrangements resulted in multiple meiotic multivalents, and, contrary to the theoretical prediction, the hybrids displayed relatively high reproductive fitness (42\% of that of the control lines) and regular behavior of meiotic chromosomes. In the hybrids, we also discovered inverted meiosis, in which the first and critical stage of chromosome number reduction was replaced by the less risky stage of sister chromatid separation. We hypothesize that the ability to invert the order of the main meiotic events facilitates proper chromosome segregation and hence rescues fertility and viability in chromosomal hybrids, potentially promoting dynamic karyotype evolution and chromosomal speciation.},

@article{luqueCharacterizationNovelSilkworm2002,
	Abstract = {Sugar conjugation is a major pathway for the inactivation and excretion of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. We report here the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a phenol UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, which was named BmUGT1. The complete cDNA clone is 1.6 kb, and the gene is expressed in several tissues of fifth-instar larvae, including fat body, midgut, integument, testis, silk gland and haemocytes. The predicted protein comprises 520 amino acids and has ≈ 30\% overall amino-acid identity with other members of the UGT family. The most conserved region of the protein is the C-terminal half, which has been implicated in binding the UDP-sugar. BmUGT1 was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, and a range of compounds belonging to diverse chemical groups were assessed as potential substrates for the enzyme. The expressed enzyme had a wide substrate specificity, showing activity with flavonoids, coumarins, terpenoids and simple phenols. These results support a role for the enzyme in detoxication processes, such as minimizing the harmful effects of ingested plant allelochemicals. This work represents the first instance where an insect ugt gene has been associated with a specific enzyme activity.},

Here, we present new functionalities and major improvements of the BUSCO software, as well as the renewal and expansion of the underlying data sets in sync with the OrthoDB v10 release. Among the major novelties, BUSCO now enables phylogenetic placement of the input sequence to automatically select the most appropriate BUSCO data set for the assessment, allowing the analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes of unknown origin. A newly introduced genome workflow increases the efficiency and runtimes especially on large eukaryotic genomes. BUSCO is the only tool capable of assessing both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, and can be applied to various data types, from genome assemblies and metagenomic bins, to transcriptomes and gene sets.},

@article{marquez-corroMacroevolutionaryInsightsSedges,
	Abstract = {Changes in holocentric chromosome number due to fission and fusion have direct and immediate effects on genome structure and recombination rates. These, in turn, may influence ecology and evolutionary trajectories profoundly. Sedges of the genus Carex (Cyperaceae) comprise ca. 2000 species with holocentric chromosomes. The genus exhibits a phenomenal range in the chromosome number (2n = 10 − 132) with almost not polyploidy. In this study, we integrated the most comprehensive cytogenetic and phylogenetic data for sedges with associated climatic and morphological data to investigate the hypothesis that high recombination rates are selected when evolutionary innovation is required, using chromosome number evolution as a proxy for recombination rate. We evaluated Ornstein--Uhlenbeck models to infer shifts in chromosome number equilibrium and selective regime. We also tested the relationship between chromosome number and diversification rates. Our analyses demonstrate significant correlations between morphology and climatic niche and chromosome number in Carex. Nevertheless, the amount of chromosomal variation that we are able to explain is very small. We recognized a large number of shifts in mean chromosome number, but a significantly lower number in climatic niche and morphology. We also detected a peak in diversification rates near intermediate recombination rates. In combination, these analyses point toward the importance of chromosome evolution to the evolutionary history of Carex. Our work suggests that the effect of chromosome evolution on recombination rates, not just on reproductive isolation, may be central to the evolutionary history of sedges.},

@article{martinez-berdejaFunctionalVariantsDOG12020,
	Abstract = {The seasonal timing of seed germination determines a plant's realized environmental niche, and is important for adaptation to climate. The timing of seasonal germination depends on patterns of seed dormancy release or induction by cold and interacts with flowering-time variation to construct different seasonal life histories. To characterize the genetic basis and climatic associations of natural variation in seed chilling responses and associated life-history syndromes, we selected 559 fully sequenced accessions of the model annual species               Arabidopsis thaliana               from across a wide climate range and scored each for seed germination across a range of 13 cold stratification treatments, as well as the timing of flowering and senescence. Germination strategies varied continuously along 2 major axes: 1) Overall germination fraction and 2) induction vs. release of dormancy by cold. Natural variation in seed responses to chilling was correlated with flowering time and senescence to create a range of seasonal life-history syndromes. Genome-wide association identified several loci associated with natural variation in seed chilling responses, including a known functional polymorphism in the self-binding domain of the candidate gene               DOG1.               A phylogeny of               DOG1               haplotypes revealed ancient divergence of these functional variants associated with periods of Pleistocene climate change, and Gradient Forest analysis showed that allele turnover of candidate SNPs was significantly associated with climate gradients. These results provide evidence that               A. thaliana               's germination niche and correlated life-history syndromes are shaped by past climate cycles, as well as local adaptation to contemporary climate.},

@article{masonCooptionMicrobialAssociates2019,
	Abstract = {Plants possess a suite of traits that make them challenging to consume by insect herbivores. Plant tissues are recalcitrant, have low levels of protein, and may be well defended by chemicals. Insects use diverse strategies for overcoming these barriers, including co‐opting metabolic activities from microbial associates. In this review, we discuss the co‐option of bacteria and fungi in the herbivore gut. We particularly focus upon chewing, folivorous insects (Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) and discuss the impacts of microbial co‐option on herbivore performance and plant responses. We suggest that there are two components to microbial co‐option: fixed and plastic relationships. Fixed relationships are involved in integral dietary functions and can be performed by microbial enzymes co‐opted into the genome or by stably transferred associates. In contrast, the majority of gut symbionts appear to be looser and perform more facultative, context‐dependent functions. This more plastic, variable co‐option of bacteria likely produces a greater number of insect phenotypes, which interact differently with plant hosts. By altering plant detection of herbivory or mediating insect interactions with plant defensive compounds, microbes can effectively improve herbivore performance in real time within and between generations.},

@article{mastretta-yanesRestrictionSiteassociatedDNA2015,
	Abstract = {Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) provides researchers with the ability to record genetic polymorphism across thousands of loci for nonmodel organisms, potentially revolutionizing the field of molecular ecology. However, as with other genotyping methods, RADseq is prone to a number of sources of error that may have consequential effects for population genetic inferences, and these have received only limited attention in terms of the estimation and reporting of genotyping error rates. Here we use individual sample replicates, under the expectation of identical genotypes, to quantify genotyping error in the absence of a reference genome. We then use sample replicates to (i) optimize de novo assembly parameters within the program Stacks, by minimizing error and maximizing the retrieval of informative loci; and (ii) quantify error rates for loci, alleles and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. As an empirical example, we use a double-digest RAD data set of a nonmodel plant species, Berberis alpina, collected from high-altitude mountains in Mexico.},

@article{mcveanEffectsHillRobertsonInterference,
	Abstract = {Associations between selected alleles and the genetic backgrounds on which they are found can reduce the efficacy of selection. We consider the extent to which such interference, known as the Hill-Robertson effect, acting between weakly selected alleles, can restrict molecular adaptation and affect patterns of polymorphism and divergence. In particular, we focus on synonymous-site mutations, considering the fate of novel variants in a two-locus model and the equilibrium effects of interference with multiple loci and reversible mutation. We find that weak selection Hill-Robertson (wsHR) interference can considerably reduce adaptation, e.g., codon bias, and, to a lesser extent, levels of polymorphism, particularly in regions of low recombination. Interference causes the frequency distribution of segregating sites to resemble that expected from more weakly selected mutations and also generates specific patterns of linkage disequilibrium. While the selection coefficients involved are small, the fitness consequences of wsHR interference across the genome can be considerable. We suggest that wsHR interference is an important force in the evolution of nonrecombining genomes and may explain the unexpected constancy of codon bias across species of very different census population sizes, as well as several unusual features of codon usage in Drosophila.},

@report{meierHaplotypeTaggingReveals2020,
	Abstract = {Abstract                        Genetic variation segregates as linked sets of variants, or haplotypes. Haplotypes and linkage are central to genetics and underpin virtually all genetic and selection analysis. And yet, genomic data often lack haplotype information, due to constraints in sequencing technologies. Here we present ``haplotagging'', a simple, low-cost linked-read sequencing technique that allows sequencing of hundreds of individuals while retaining linkage information. We apply haplotagging to construct megabase-size haplotypes for over 600 individual butterflies (             Heliconius erato             and             H. melpomene             ), which form overlapping hybrid zones across an elevational gradient in Ecuador. Haplotagging identifies loci controlling distinctive high- and lowland wing color patterns. Divergent haplotypes are found at the same major loci in both species, while chromosome rearrangements show no parallelism. Remarkably, in both species the geographic clines for the major wing pattern loci are displaced by 18 km, leading to the rise of a novel hybrid morph in the centre of the hybrid zone. We propose that shared warning signalling (M{\"u}llerian mimicry) may couple the cline shifts seen in both species, and facilitate the parallel co-emergence of a novel hybrid morph in both co-mimetic species. Our results show the power of efficient haplotyping methods when combined with large-scale sequencing data from natural populations.                                   One-sentence summary                            Haplotagging, a novel linked-read sequencing technique that enables whole genome haplotyping in large populations, reveals the formation of a novel hybrid race in parallel hybrid zones of two co-mimicking               Heliconius               butterfly species through strikingly parallel divergences in their genomes.},

@article{meiselChromosomeGermanCockroach2019,
	Abstract = {Background: Sex chromosome evolution is a dynamic process that can proceed at varying rates across lineages. For example, different chromosomes can be sex-linked between closely related species, whereas other sex chromosomes have been conserved for {$>$} 100 million years. Cases of long-term sex chromosome conservation could be informative of factors that constrain sex chromosome evolution. Cytological similarities between the X chromosomes of the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) and most flies suggest that they may be homologous---possibly representing an extreme case of long-term conservation. Results: To test the hypothesis that the cockroach and fly X chromosomes are homologous, we analyzed whole-genome sequence data from cockroaches. We found evidence in both sequencing coverage and heterozygosity that a significant excess of the same genes are on both the cockroach and fly X chromosomes. We also present evidence that the candidate X-linked cockroach genes may be dosage compensated in hemizygous males. Consistent with this hypothesis, three regulators of transcription and chromatin on the fly X chromosome are conserved in the cockroach genome. Conclusions: Our results support our hypothesis that the German cockroach shares the same X chromosome as most flies. This may represent the convergent evolution of the X chromosome in the lineages leading to cockroaches and flies. Alternatively, the common ancestor of most insects may have had an X chromosome that resembled the extant cockroach and fly X. Cockroaches and flies diverged ∼ 400 million years ago, which would be the longest documented conservation of a sex chromosome. Cockroaches and flies have different mechanisms of sex determination, raising the possibility that the X chromosome was conserved despite the evolution of the sex determination pathway.},

@article{menzMechanismsConsequencesPartial2019,
	Abstract = {Partial migration, where a proportion of a population migrates, while other individuals remain resident, is widespread across most migratory lineages. However, the mechanisms driving individual differences in migratory tendency are still relatively poorly understood in most taxa, but may be influenced by morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits, controlled by phenotypic plasticity and the underlying genetic complex. Insects differ from vertebrates in that partial migration is often associated with pronounced morphological differences between migratory and resident phenotypes, such as wing presence or length. In contrast, the mechanisms influencing migratory tendency in wing-monomorphic insects is less clear. Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of terrestrial migrants, with trillions of animals moving across the globe annually, and understanding the drivers and extent of partial migration across populations will have considerable implications for ecosystem services, such as the management of pests and the conservation of threatened or beneficial species. Here, we present an overview of our current but incomplete knowledge of partial migration in insects. We discuss the factors that lead to the maintenance of partial migration within populations, and the conditions that may influence individual decision making, particularly in the context of individual fitness and reproductive tradeoffs. Finally, we highlight current gaps in knowledge and areas of future research that should prove fruitful in understanding the ecological and evolutionary drivers, and consequences of partial migration in insects.},

@article{mitaGenomeSequenceSilkworm2004,
	Abstract = {We performed threefold shotgun sequencing of the silkworm ( Bombyx mori ) genome to obtain a draft sequence and establish a basic resource for comprehensive genome analysis. By using the newly developed RAMEN assembler, the sequence data derived from whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing were assembled into 49,345 scaffolds that span a total length of 514 Mb including gaps and 387 Mb without gaps. Because the genome size of the silkworm is estimated to be 530 Mb, almost 97\% of the genome has been organized in scaffolds, of which 75\% has been sequenced. By carrying out a BLAST search for 50 characteristic Bombyx genes and 11,202 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in a Bombyx EST database against the WGS sequence data, we evaluated the validity of the sequence for elucidating the majority of silkworm genes. Analysis of the WGS data revealed that the silkworm genome contains many repetitive sequences with an average length of \&lt;500 bp. These repetitive sequences appear to have been derived from truncated transposons, which are interspersed at 2.5- to 3-kb intervals throughout the genome. This pattern suggests that silkworm may have an active mechanism that promotes removal of transposons from the genome. We also found evidence for insertions of mitochondrial DNA fragments at 9 sites. A search for Bombyx orthologs to Drosophila genes controlling sex determination in the WGS data revealed 11 Bombyx genes and suggested that the sex-determining systems differ profoundly between the two species.},

@article{moriyamaGeneLengthCodon1998,
	Abstract = {The relationship between gene length and synonymous codon usage bias was investigated in Drosophila melanogaster , Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Simulation studies indicate that the correlations observed in the three organisms are unlikely to be due to sampling errors or any potential bias in the methods used to measure codon usage bias. The correlation was significantly positive in E.coli genes, whereas negative correlations were obtained for D.melanogaster and S.cerevisiae genes. When only ribosomal protein genes were used, whose expression levels are assumed to be similar, E.coli and S.cerevisiae showed significantly positive correlations. For the two eukaryotes, the distribution of effective number of codons was different in short genes (300--500 bp) compared with longer genes; this was not observed in E.coli . Both positive and negative correlations can be explained by translational selection. Energetically costly longer genes have higher codon usage bias to maximize translational efficiency. Selection may also be acting to reduce the size of highly expressed proteins, and the effect is particularly pronounced in eukaryotes. The different relationships between codon usage bias and gene length observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes may be the consequence of these different types of selection.},

@article{murataUtilizationLipidFlight2013,
	Abstract = {Research of the physiological traits of a long-distance migratory insect, the common cutworm Spodoptera litura, in relation to flight and reproduction, was focused on triacylglycerol (TG) levels and their fatty acid composition.Tethered flight experiments demonstrated that three-day old male moths can fly more than 20 h. Among eight identified fatty acids of which the adult TG is composed, the ratios of the following unsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic acid (C 16:1), oleic acid (C 18:1), linoleic acid (C 18:2) and linolenic acid (C 18:3), gradually declined with longer flight duration. On the other hand, the TG levels of non-flown males reared for ten days on only water, were the same as those of three-day old males after 12 hr of flight, but the ratios of these unsaturated fatty acids in TG's remained nearly unchanged. These results suggest that the unsaturated fatty acids in TG are mainly used as a flight energy source.As ovarian development in females of this species occurs shortly after adult emergence, long-distance migratory capacity has been regarded as highly unlikely. In fact, ovarian development was completed within three days after adult emergence and females laid eggs thereafter. During this three day period TG increased in the ovary, accompanied by increasing ratios of unsaturated fatty acids in the TG's and the ovary eventually occupied most of the abdomen, in spite of a nearly constant level of TG in the abdomen and unchanged ratio of its unsaturated fatty acids. These facts support the transfer of TG from the fat body to the ovary, and further suggest that the mature females utilize the TG deposited in the ovaries as a flight energy source. Then if they migrate a long distance, they use residual TG after flight for egg production.},

	Abstract = {Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyse the reaction of glyco-conjugation of various biomolecules by transferring the saccharide moieties from an activated nucleotide sugar to nucleophilic glycosyl acceptor. In insects, GTs show diverse temporal and site-specific expression patterns and thus play significant roles in forming the complex biomolecular structures that are necessary for insect survival, growth and development. Several insects exhibit GT-mediated detoxification as a key defence strategy against plant allelochemicals and xenobiotic compounds, as well as a mechanism for pesticide cross-resistance. Also, these enzymes act as crucial effectors and modulators in various developmental processes of insects such as eye development, UV shielding, cuticle formation, epithelial development and other specialized functions. Furthermore, many of the known insect GTs have been shown to play a fundamental role in other physiological processes like body pigmentation, cuticular tanning, chemosensation and stress response. This review provides a detailed overview of the multifaceted functionality of insect GTs and summarizes numerous case studies associated with it.},

@article{narlikarIdentifyingRegulatoryElements2009,
	Abstract = {Proper development and functioning of an organism depends on precise spatial and temporal expression of all its genes. These coordinated expression-patterns are maintained primarily through the process of transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional regulation is mediated by proteins binding to regulatory elements on the DNA in a combinatorial manner, where particular combinations of transcription factor binding sites establish specific regulatory codes. In this review, we survey experimental and computational approaches geared towards the identification of proximal and distal gene regulatory elements in the genomes of complex eukaryotes. Available approaches that decipher the genetic structure and function of regulatory elements by exploiting various sources of information like gene expression data, chromatin structure, DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors, cooperativity of transcription factors, etc. are highlighted. We also discuss the relevance of regulatory elements in the context of human health through examples of mutations in some of these regions having serious implications in misregulation of genes and being strongly associated with human disorders.},

The literature is strewn with examples of conserved non-coding sequences being able to drive reporter expression, but the extent to which such sequences are actually used endogenously in vivo is only now being rigorously explored using unbiased genome-scale approaches. Here, we review the emerging picture, examining the extent to which conserved non-coding sequences equivalently regulate gene expression in different species, or at different developmental stages, and how genomics approaches are revealing the relationship between sequence conservation and functional use of cis-regulatory elements.},

@article{nokkalaHolocentricChromosomesMeiosis2004,
	Abstract = {The number of chiasmata in bivalents and the behaviour of chiasmata during the meiotic divisions were studied in Psylla foersteri (Psylloidea, Homoptera). Two chiasmata with a frequency of 97\% and one or three chiasmata with frequencies of 2\% and 0.9\%, respectively, were observed in the largest bivalent in male meiosis. Meiosis was normal for the largest bivalents with one or two chiasmata, whereas bivalents with three chiasmata were not capable of completing anaphase I because of their inability to resolve the chiasma located in the middle. Consequently, the bivalent was seen as a laggard joining together two metaphase II daughter plates. Apparently, cells of this kind are eliminated. Inability to resolve the chiasma situated in the middle is attributed to the condensation process, which is unable to change the spatial orientation of successive chiasma loops in holocentric bivalents so that chiasma loops would be arranged perpendicular to each other at metaphase I. Thus they retain their parallel orientation from diplotene to metaphase I. Consequently, sister chromatid cohesion is exposed for release only in the outermost chiasmata but the chiasma in the middle continues to interlock the chromosomes in the bivalent. The elimination of the cells carrying bivalents with more than two chiasmata creates a strong selection against the formation of more than two chiasmata in holocentric bivalents.},

@article{novoaElucidationCodonUsage2019,
	Abstract = {Abstract             Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, multiple codons are translated into the same amino acid. Despite being ``synonymous,'' these codons are not equally used. Selective pressures are thought to drive the choice among synonymous codons within a genome, while GC content, which is typically attributed to mutational drift, is the major determinant of variation across species. Here, we find that in addition to GC content, interspecies codon usage signatures can also be detected. More specifically, we show that a single amino acid, arginine, is the major contributor to codon usage bias differences across domains of life. We then exploit this finding and show that domain-specific codon bias signatures can be used to classify a given sequence into its corresponding domain of life with high accuracy. We then wondered whether the inclusion of codon usage codon autocorrelation patterns, which reflects the nonrandom distribution of codon occurrences throughout a transcript, might improve the classification performance of our algorithm. However, we find that autocorrelation patterns are not domain-specific, and surprisingly, are unrelated to tRNA reusage, in contrast to previous reports. Instead, our results suggest that codon autocorrelation patterns are a by-product of codon optimality throughout a sequence, where highly expressed genes display autocorrelated ``optimal'' codons, whereas lowly expressed genes display autocorrelated ``nonoptimal'' codons.},

	Abstract = {It is necessary to identify suitable alternative crops to ensure the nutritional demands of a growing global population. The genome of Moringa oleifera, a fast-growing drought-tolerant orphan crop with highly valuable agronomical, nutritional and pharmaceutical properties, has recently been reported. We model here gene family evolution in Moringa as compared with ten other flowering plant species. Despite the reduced number of genes in the compact Moringa genome, 101 gene families, grouping 957 genes, were found as significantly expanded. Expanded families were highly enriched for chloroplastidic and photosynthetic functions. Indeed, almost half of the genes belonging to Moringa expanded families grouped with their Arabidopsis thaliana plastid encoded orthologs. Microsynteny analysis together with modeling the distribution of synonymous substitutions rates, supported most plastid duplicated genes originated recently through a burst of simultaneous insertions of large regions of plastid DNA into the nuclear genome. These, together with abundant short insertions of plastid DNA, contributed to the occurrence of massive amounts of plastid DNA in the Moringa nuclear genome, representing 4.71\%, the largest reported so far. Our study provides key genetic resources for future breeding programs and highlights the potential of plastid DNA to impact the structure and function of nuclear genes and genomes.},

@article{orsucciLarvalTranscriptomicResponse2018,
	Abstract = {Background: Most phytophagous insects have morphological, behavioral and physiological adaptations allowing them to specialize on one or a few plant species. Identifying the mechanisms involved in host plant specialization is crucial to understand the role of divergent selection between different environments in species diversification, and to identify sustainable targets for the management of insect pest species. In the present study, we measured larval phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to host plants in two related phytophagous lepidopteran species: the European corn borer (ECB), a worldwide pest of maize, and the adzuki bean borer (ABB), which feeds of various dicotyledons. Our aim was to identify the genes and functions underlying host specialization and/or divergence between ECB and ABB. Results: At the phenotypic level, we observed contrasted patterns of survival, weight gain and developmental time between ECB and ABB, and within ECB and ABB reared on two different host plants. At the transcriptomic level, around 8\% of the genes were differentially expressed (DE) between species and/or host plant. 70\% of these DE genes displayed a divergent pattern of expression between ECB and ABB, regardless of the host, while the remaining 30\% were involved in the plastic response between hosts. We further categorized plastic DE genes according to their parallel or opposite pattern between ECB and ABB to specifically identify candidate genes involved in the species divergence by host specialization. These candidates highlighted a comprehensive response, involving functions related to plant recognition, digestion, detoxification, immunity and development. Last, we detected viral, bacterial, and yeast genes whose incidence contrasted ECB and ABB samples, and maize and mugwort conditions. We suggest that these microorganism communities might influence the survival, metabolism and defense patterns observed in ECB and ABB larvae. Conclusions: The comprehensive approach developed in the present study allowed to identify phenotypic specialization patterns and underlying candidate molecular mechanisms, and highlighted the putative role of microorganisms in the insect-host plant interaction. These findings offer the opportunity to pinpoint specific and sustainable molecular or physiological targets for the regulation of ECB pest populations.},

The application of genomic approaches to evolutionary studies of coloration is providing new insight into the genetic architectures underlying colour traits, including the importance of large-e ffect mutations and supergenes, the role of development in shaping genetic variation and the origins of adaptive variation, which often involves adaptive introgression. Improved knowledge of the genetic basis of traits can facilitate field studies of natural selection and sexual selection, making it possible for strong selection and its influence on the genome to be demonstrated in wild populations.},

@article{payneRNAmediatedGeneRegulation2018,
	Abstract = {Much of gene regulation is carried out by proteins that bind DNA or RNA molecules at specific sequences. One class of such proteins is transcription factors, which bind short DNA sequences to regulate transcription. Another class is RNA binding proteins, which bind short RNA sequences to regulate RNA maturation, transport, and stability. Here, we study the robustness and evolvability of these regulatory mechanisms. To this end, we use experimental binding data from 172 human and fruit fly transcription factors and RNA binding proteins as well as human polymorphism data to study the evolution of binding sites in vivo. We find little difference between the robustness of regulatory protein--RNA interactions and transcription factor--DNA interactions to DNA mutations. In contrast, we find that RNA-mediated regulation is less evolvable than transcriptional regulation, because mutations are less likely to create interactions of an RNA molecule with a new RNA binding protein than they are to create interactions of a gene regulatory region with a new transcription factor. Our observations are consistent with the high level of conservation observed for interactions between RNA binding proteins and their target molecules as well as the evolutionary plasticity of regulatory regions bound by transcription factors. They may help explain why transcriptional regulation is implicated in many more evolutionary adaptations and innovations than RNA-mediated gene regulation.},

Despite the importance of wing scales, however, we still have a limited understanding of the genetic mechanisms that underlie scale patterning, development, and coloration. Here, we explore the function of the phenoloxidase‐encoding gene laccase2 in wing and scale development in the nymphalid butterfly Vanessa cardui. Somatic deletion mosaics of laccase2 generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing presented several distinct mutant phenotypes. Consistent with the work in other nonlepidopteran insect groups, we observed reductions in melanin pigmentation and defects in cuticle formation. We were also surprised, however, to see distinct effects on scale development including complete loss of wing scales. This study highlights laccase2 as a gene that plays multiple roles in wing and scale development and provides new insight into the evolution of lepidopteran wing coloration.},

@article{podsiadlowskiGenomeAssemblyAnnotation2021,
	Abstract = {Conservation genomics has made dramatic improvements over the past decade, leveraging the power of genomes to infer diverse parameters central to conservation management questions. However, much of this effort has focused upon vertebrate species, despite insects providing similar flagship status with the added benefit of smaller genomes, shorter generation times and extensive historical collections in museums. Here we present the genome of the Apollo butterfly (Parnassius apollo, Papilionidae), an iconic endangered butterfly, which like many species in this genus, needs conservation genomic attention yet lacks a genome. Using 68.7\,Gb of long-read data (N50\,=\,15.2\,kb) we assembled a 1.4\,Gb genome for the Apollo butterfly, making this the largest sequenced Lepidopteran genome to date. The assembly was highly contiguous (N50\,=\,7.1 Mb) and complete (97\% of Lepidopteran BUSCOs were single-copy and complete) and consisted of 1,707 contigs. Using RNAseq data and Arthropoda proteins, we annotated 28.3K genes. Alignment with the closest-related chromosome-level assembly, Papilio bianor, reveals a highly conserved chromosomal organization, albeit genome size is highly expanded in the Apollo butterfly, due primarily to a dramatic increase in repetitive element content. Using this alignment for superscaffolding places the P. apollo genome in to 31 chromosomal scaffolds, and together with our functional annotation, provides an essential resource for advancing conservation genomics in a flagship species for insect conservation.},

@article{pringleConvergenceConstraintPotential2019,
	Abstract = {Ants are a hugely diverse family of eusocial insects that dominate terrestrial ecosystems all over the planet. Did mutualistic gut microbes help ants to achieve their diversity and ecological dominance? Initial studies suggested the potential for widespread convergence in ant gut bacterial communities based on dietary niche, but it now seems possible that dedicated bacterial symbionts are restricted to a minority of ant lineages (Russell et al., 2017). Nevertheless, as most ants are omnivores, the evidence so far has suggested a broad, positive correlation between the evolution of dietary specialization and ant investment in nutrient‐provisioning gut bacteria. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Sapountzis et al. (2019) and Rubin et al. (2019) examine the evolution of gut bacterial communities in two iconic ant taxa---the attine fungus farmers and the Pseudomyrmex plant bodyguards, respectively---in a comparative context. By comparing gut bacteria between ant species of differing dietary specialization within each taxon, these studies demonstrate a hint of convergence in the midst of widespread apparent constraints. These results raise numerous interesting questions about the nature of these apparent constraints and whether they are causes or consequences of varying investment by ants to mutualism with their gut microbes.},

@article{protacioMolecularMechanismsEnvironmentally2022,
	Abstract = {It has long been known (circa 1917) that environmental conditions, as well as speciation, can affect dramatically the frequency distribution of Spo11/Rec12-dependent meiotic recombination. Here, by analyzing DNA sequence-dependent meiotic recombination hotspots in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we reveal a molecular basis for these phenomena. The impacts of changing environmental conditions (temperature, nutrients, and osmolarity) on local rates of recombination are mediated directly by DNA site-dependent hotspots (M26, CCAAT, and Oligo-C). This control is exerted through environmental condition-responsive signal transduction networks (involving Atf1, Pcr1, Php2, Php3, Php5, and Rst2). Strikingly, individual hotspots modulate rates of recombination over a very broad dynamic range in response to changing conditions. They can range from being quiescent to being highly proficient at promoting activity of the basal recombination machinery (Spo11/Rec12 complex). Moreover, each different class of hotspot functions as an independently controlled rheostat; a condition that increases the activity of one class can decrease the activity of another class. Together, the independent modulation of recombination rates by each different class of DNA site-dependent hotspots (of which there are many) provides a molecular mechanism for highly dynamic, large-scale changes in the global frequency distribution of meiotic recombination. Because hotspot-activating DNA sites discovered in fission yeast are conserved functionally in other species, this process can also explain the previously enigmatic, Prdm9-independent, evolutionarily rapid changes in hotspot usage between closely related species, subspecies, and isolated populations of the same species.},

@article{rastasConstructionUltradenseLinkage2016,
	Abstract = {High-density linkage maps are important tools for genome biology and evolutionary genetics by quantifying the extent of recombination, linkage disequilibrium, and chromosomal rearrangements across chromosomes, sexes, and populations. They provide one of the best ways to validate and refine de novo genome assemblies, with the power to identify errors in assemblies increasing with marker density. However, assembly of high-density linkage maps is still challenging due to software limitations. We describe LepMAP2, a software for ultradense genome-wide linkage map construction. Lep-MAP2 can handle various family structures and can account for achiasmatic meiosis to gain linkage map accuracy. Simulations show that Lep-MAP2 outperforms other available mapping software both in computational efficiency and accuracy. When applied to two large F2-generation recombinant crosses between two nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations, it produced two high-density (\textasciitilde 6 markers/cM) linkage maps containing 18,691 and 20,054 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The two maps showed a high degree of synteny, but female maps were 1.5--2 times longer than male maps in all linkage groups, suggesting genome-wide recombination suppression in males. Comparison with the genome sequence of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) revealed a high degree of interspecific synteny with a low frequency ({$<$}5\%) of interchromosomal rearrangements. However, a fairly large (ca. 10 Mb) translocation from autosome to sex chromosome was detected in both maps. These results illustrate the utility and novel features of Lep-MAP2 in assembling highdensity linkage maps, and their usefulness in revealing evolutionarily interesting properties of genomes, such as strong genome-wide sex bias in recombination rates.},

	Abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Linkage mapping provides a practical way to anchor de novo genome assemblies into chromosomes and to detect chimeric or otherwise erroneous contigs. Such anchoring improves with higher number of markers and individuals, as long as the mapping software can handle all the information. Recent software Lep-MAP3 can robustly construct linkage maps for millions of genotyped markers and on thousands of individuals, providing optimal maps for genome anchoring. For such large datasets, automated and robust genome anchoring tool is especially valuable and can significantly reduce intensive computational and manual work involved.                                         Results               Here, we present a software Lep-Anchor (LA) to anchor genome assemblies automatically using dense linkage maps. As the main novelty, it takes into account the uncertainty of the linkage map positions caused by low recombination regions, cross type or poor mapping data quality. Furthermore, it can automatically detect and cut chimeric contigs, and use contig--contig, single read or alternative genome assembly alignments as additional information on contig order and orientations and to collapse haplotype contigs. We demonstrate the performance of LA using real data and show that it outperforms ALLMAPS on anchoring completeness and speed. Accuracy-wise LA and ALLMAPS are about equal, but at the expense of lower completeness of ALLMAPS. The software Chromonomer was faster than the other two methods but has major limitations and is lower in accuracy. We also show that with additional information, such as contig--contig and read alignments, the anchoring completeness can be improved by up to 70\% without significant loss in accuracy. Based on simulated data, we conclude that the anchoring accuracy can be improved by utilizing information about map position uncertainty. Accuracy is the rate of contigs in correct orientation and completeness is the number contigs with inferred orientation.                                         Availability and implementation               Lep-Anchor is available with the source code under GNU general public license from http://sourceforge.net/projects/lep-anchor.

Moreover, linkage mapping is one of the best ways to detect errors in de novo genome assemblies, as well as to orient and place assembly contigs within chromosomes. A small mapping cross of tens of individuals will detect many errors where distant parts of the genome are erroneously joined together. With more individuals and markers, even more local errors can be detected and more contigs can be oriented. However, the tools that are currently available for constructing linkage maps are not well suited for large, possible low-coverage, whole genome sequencing datasets.},

@article{ravenscraftNoEvidenceThat2019,
	Abstract = {Gut microbes are believed to play a critical role in most animal life, yet fitness effects and cost--benefit trade‐offs incurred by the host are poorly understood. Unlike most hosts studied to date, butterflies largely acquire their nutrients from larval feeding, leaving relatively little opportunity for nutritive contributions by the adult's microbiota. This provides an opportunity to measure whether hosting gut microbiota comes at a net nutritional price. Because host and bacteria may compete for sugars, we hypothesized that gut flora would be nutritionally neutral to adult butterflies with plentiful food, but detrimental to semistarved hosts, especially when at high density. We held field‐caught adult Speyeria mormonia under abundant or restricted food conditions. Because antibiotic treatments did not generate consistent variation in their gut microbiota, we used interindividual variability in bacterial loads and operational taxonomic unit abundances to examine correlations between host fitness and the abdominal microbiota present upon natural death. We detected strikingly few relationships between microbial flora and host fitness. Neither total bacterial load nor the abundances of dominant bacterial taxa were related to butterfly fecundity, egg mass or egg chemical content. Increased abundance of a Commensalibacter species did correlate with longer host life span, while increased abundance of a Rhodococcus species correlated with shorter life span. Contrary to our expectations, these relationships were unchanged by food availability to the host and were unrelated to reproductive output. Our results suggest the butterfly microbiota comprises parasitic, commensal and beneficial taxa that together do not impose a net reproductive cost, even under caloric stress.},

@article{rayChromatinConformationRemains2019,
	Abstract = {Heat shock (HS) initiates rapid, extensive, and evolutionarily conserved changes in transcription that are accompanied by chromatin decondensation and nucleosome loss at HS loci. Here we have employed in situ Hi-C to determine how heat stress affects long-range chromatin conformation in human and               Drosophila               cells. We found that compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) remain unchanged by an acute HS. Knockdown of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), the master transcriptional regulator of the HS response, identified HSF1-dependent genes and revealed that up-regulation is often mediated by distal HSF1 bound enhancers. HSF1-dependent genes were usually found in the same TAD as the nearest HSF1 binding site. Although most interactions between HSF1 binding sites and target promoters were established in the nonheat shock (NHS) condition, a subset increased contact frequency following HS. Integrating information about HSF1 binding strength, RNA polymerase abundance at the HSF1 bound sites (putative enhancers), and contact frequency with a target promoter accurately predicted which up-regulated genes were direct targets of HSF1 during HS. Our results suggest that the chromatin conformation necessary for a robust HS response is preestablished in NHS cells of diverse metazoan species.},

However, because of their repetitive nature, they are difficult to annotate and discovering the specific roles they may play in a lineage can be a daunting task. Heliconiine butterflies are models for the study of multiple evolutionary processes including phenotype evolution and hybridization. We attempted to determine how TEs may play a role in the diversification of genomes within this clade by performing a detailed examination of TE content and accumulation in 19 species whose genomes were recently sequenced. We found that TE content has diverged substantially and rapidly in the time since several subclades shared a common ancestor with each lineage harboring a unique TE repertoire. Several novel SINE lineages have been established that are restricted to a subset of species. Furthermore, the previously described SINE, Metulj, appears to have gone extinct in two subclades while expanding to significant numbers in others. This diversity in TE content and activity has the potential to impact how heliconiine butterflies continue to evolve and diverge.},

	Abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} The diversity of butterfly color patterns can be attributed to a relatively small number of pattern elements that are homologous across Lepidoptera. Although genes involved in patterning some of these elements have been identified, the development of several major elements remains poorly understood. To identify genes underlying wing pupal cuticle markings and wing margin color patterns, we examined expression of the candidate transcription factors Engrailed/Invected (En/Inv), Distal-less (Dll), Cubitus interruptus (Ci), and Spalt in two nymphalids: Junonia coenia and Bicyclus anynana. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We found that En/Inv, Dll, and Ci mark domains on the J. coenia last-instar forewing disc that closely correspond to the position and shape of pupal cuticle markings. We also found that Spalt demarcates wing margin color patterns in both J. coenia and B. anynana, and that CRISPR/Cas9 deletions in the spalt gene result in reduction and loss of wing margin color patterns in J. coenia. These data demonstrate a role for spalt in promoting wing margin color patterning, in addition to its previously described role in eyespot patterning. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Our observations support the model that a core set of regulatory genes are redeployed multiple times, and in multiple roles, during butterfly wing pattern development. Of these genes, spalt is of special interest as it plays a dual role in both eyespot and margin color pattern development.},

Determining the composition of pooled samples can be difficult, especially at the scale of modern sequencing data and reference databases. Here we propose a novel method for taxonomic profiling in pooled DNA that combines the speed and low-memory requirements of k-mer based pseudoalignment with a likelihood framework that uses base quality information to better resolve multiply mapped reads. We apply the method to the problem of classifying 16S rRNA reads using a reference database of known organisms, a common challenge in microbiome research. Using simulations, we show the method is accurate across a variety of read lengths, with different length reference sequences, at different sample depths, and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, where we reanalyze previous genetic association data to show our method discovers a larger number of quantitative trait associations than other widely used methods. We implement our method in the software Karp, for k-mer based analysis of read pools, to provide a novel combination of speed and accuracy that is uniquely suited for enhancing discoveries in microbial studies.},

	Abstract = {We analyzed the distribution of 54 families of transposable elements (TEs; transposons, LTR retrotransposons, and non-LTR retrotransposons) in the chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, using data from the sequenced genome. The density of LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons (RNA-based elements) was high in regions with low recombination rates, but there was no clear tendency to parallel the recombination rate. However, the density of transposons (DNA-based elements) was significantly negatively correlated with recombination rate. The accumulation of TEs in regions of reduced recombination rate is compatible with selection acting against TEs, as selection is expected to be weaker in regions with lower recombination. The differences in the relationship between recombination rate and TE density that exist between chromosome arms suggest that TE distribution depends on specific characteristics of the chromosomes (chromatin structure, distribution of other sequences), the TEs themselves (transposition mechanism), and the species (reproductive system, effective population size, etc.), that have differing influences on the effect of natural selection acting against the TE insertions.},

	Abstract = {For half a century population genetics studies have put type II restriction endonucleases to work. Now, coupled with massively‐parallel, short‐read sequencing, the family of RAD protocols that wields these enzymes has generated vast genetic knowledge from the natural world. Here, we describe the first software natively capable of using paired‐end sequencing to derive short contigs from de novo RAD data. Stacks version 2 employs a de Bruijn graph assembler to build and connect contigs from forward and reverse reads for each de novo RAD locus, which it then uses as a reference for read alignments. The new architecture allows all the individuals in a metapopulation to be considered at the same time as each RAD locus is processed. This enables a Bayesian genotype caller to provide precise SNPs, and a robust algorithm to phase those SNPs into long haplotypes, generating RAD loci that are 400--800 bp in length. To prove its recall and precision, we tested the software with simulated data and compared reference‐aligned and de novo analyses of three empirical data sets. Our study shows that the latest version of Stacks is highly accurate and outperforms other software in assembling and genotyping paired‐end de novo data sets.},

@article{rodriguez-caroGenomeAssemblyDogface2020,
	Abstract = {Abstract             Comparisons of high-quality, reference butterfly, and moth genomes have been instrumental to advancing our understanding of how hybridization, and natural selection drive genomic change during the origin of new species and novel traits. Here, we present a genome assembly of the Southern Dogface butterfly, Zerene cesonia (Pieridae) whose brilliant wing colorations have been implicated in developmental plasticity, hybridization, sexual selection, and speciation. We assembled 266,407,278\,bp of the Z.~cesonia genome, which accounts for 98.3\% of the estimated 271\,Mb genome size. Using a hybrid approach involving Chicago libraries with Hi-Rise assembly and a diploid Meraculous assembly, the final haploid genome was assembled. In the final assembly, nearly all autosomes and the Z chromosome were assembled into single scaffolds. The largest 29 scaffolds accounted for 91.4\% of the genome assembly, with the remaining ∼8\% distributed among another 247 scaffolds and overall N50 of 9.2\,Mb. Tissue-specific RNA-seq informed annotations identified 16,442 protein-coding genes, which included 93.2\% of the arthropod Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO). The Z.~cesonia genome assembly had ∼9\% identified as repetitive elements, with a transposable element landscape rich in helitrons. Similar to other Lepidoptera genomes, Z.~cesonia showed a high conservation of chromosomal synteny. The Z.~cesonia assembly provides a high-quality reference for studies of chromosomal arrangements in the Pierid family, as well as for population, phylo, and functional genomic studies of adaptation and speciation.},

@article{roffEvolutionGeneticsMigration2007,
	Abstract = {Because areas suitable for growth and reproduction are often ephemeral, a primary selective force in the evolution of migratory behavior in insects is the need to colonize new habitats. However, both migration itself and flight capability reduce present reproductive success. Thus the long-term fitness benefit of migration, the colonization of new habitats, is balanced by a short-term reduction in fitness, the result being that variation for migratory ability is preserved in a population. Migration is but one component of a wide suite of functionally connected traits that together form a migratory syndrome. Genetic variation is found in all components of the migratory syndrome, and selection for migration results in a change in the frequency of expression of these components, which can be analyzed and predicted using the mathematics of quantitative genetics. We illustrate this evolutionary interplay with the example of the evolution of wing dimorphism in the sand cricket.},

@article{rojanoRegulatoryVariantsDetection2019,
	Abstract = {Variants within non-coding genomic regions can greatly affect disease. In recent years, increasing focus has been given to these variants, and how they can alter regulatory elements, such as enhancers, transcription factor binding sites and DNA methylation regions. Such variants can be considered regulatory variants. Concurrently, much effort has been put into establishing international consortia to undertake large projects aimed at discovering regulatory elements in different tissues, cell lines and organisms, and probing the effects of genetic variants on regulation by measuring gene expression. Here, we describe methods and techniques for discovering disease-associated non-coding variants using sequencing technologies. We then explain the computational procedures that can be used for annotating these variants using the information from the aforementioned projects, and prediction of their putative effects, including potential pathogenicity, based on rule-based and machine learning approaches. We provide the details of techniques to validate these predictions, by mapping chromatin--chromatin and chromatin--protein interactions, and introduce Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Associated Protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology, which has already been used in this field and is likely to have a big impact on its future evolution. We also give examples of regulatory variants associated with multiple complex diseases. This review is aimed at bioinformaticians interested in the characterization of regulatory variants, molecular biologists and geneticists interested in understanding more about the nature and potential role of such variants from a functional point of views, and clinicians who may wish to learn about variants in non-coding genomic regions associated with a given disease and find out what to do next to uncover how they impact on the underlying mechanisms.},

@article{rosserComplexBasisHybrid2022,
	Abstract = {Hybrids between species are often sterile or inviable. Hybrid unfitness usually evolves first in the heterogametic sex---a pattern known as Haldane's rule. The genetics of Haldane's rule have been extensively studied in species where the male is the heterogametic (XX/XY) sex, but its basis in taxa where the female is heterogametic (ZW/ZZ), such as Lepidoptera and birds, is largely unknown. Here, we analyse a new case of female hybrid sterility between geographic subspecies of Heliconius pardalinus. The two subspecies mate freely in captivity, but female F1 hybrids in both directions of cross are sterile. Sterility is due to arrested development of oocytes after they become differentiated from nurse cells, but before yolk deposition. We backcrossed fertile male F1 hybrids to parental females and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for female sterility. We also identified genes differentially expressed in the ovary as a function of oocyte development. The Z chromosome has a major effect, similar to the `large X effect' in Drosophila, with strong epistatic interactions between loci at either end of the Z chromosome, and between the Z chromosome and autosomal loci on chromosomes 8 and 20. By intersecting the list of genes within these QTLs with those differentially expressed in sterile and fertile hybrids, we identified three candidate genes with relevant phenotypes. This study is the first to characterize hybrid sterility using genome mapping in the Lepidoptera and shows that it is produced by multiple complex epistatic interactions often involving the sex chromosome, as predicted by the dominance theory of Haldane's rule.},

@article{rubinDietarySpecializationMutualistic2019,
	Abstract = {Acacia‐ant mutualists in the genus Pseudomyrmex nest obligately in acacia plants and, as we show through stable isotope analysis, feed at a remarkably low trophic level. Insects with diets such as these sometimes depend on bacterial symbionts for nutritional enrichment. We, therefore, examine the bacterial communities associated with acacia‐ants in order to determine whether they host bacterial partners likely to contribute to their nutrition. Despite large differences in trophic position, acaciaants and related species with generalized diets do not host distinct bacterial taxa. However, we find that a small number of previously undescribed bacterial taxa do differ in relative abundance between acacia‐ants and generalists, including several Acetobacteraceae and Nocardiaceae lineages related to common insect associates. Comparisons with an herbivorous generalist, a parasite that feeds on acacias and a mutualistic species with a generalized diet show that trophic level is likely responsible for these small differences in bacterial community structure. While we did not experimentally test for a nutritional benefit to hosts of these bacterial lineages, metagenomic analysis reveals a Bartonella relative with an intact nitrogen‐recycling pathway widespread across Pseudomyrmex mutualists and generalists. This taxon may be contributing to nitrogen enrichment of its ant hosts through urease activity and, concordant with an obligately host‐associated lifestyle, appears to be experiencing genomewide relaxed selection. The lack of distinctiveness in bacterial communities across trophic level in this group of ants shows a remarkable ability to adjust to varied diets, possibly with assistance from these diverse ant‐specific bacterial lineages.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary origins of eusociality represent increases in complexity from individual to caste-based, group reproduction. These behavioural transitions have been hypothesized to go hand in hand with an increased ability to regulate when and where genes are expressed. Bees have convergently evolved eusociality up to five times, providing a framework to test this hypothesis. To examine potential links between putative gene regulatory elements and social evolution, we compare alignable, non-coding sequences in 11 diverse bee species, encompassing three independent origins of reproductive division of labour and two elaborations of eusocial complexity. We find that rates of evolution in a number of non-coding sequences correlate with key social transitions in bees. Interestingly, while we find little evidence for convergent rate changes associated with independent origins of social behaviour, a number of molecular pathways exhibit convergent rate changes in conjunction with subsequent elaborations of social organization. We also present evidence that many novel non-coding regions may have been recruited alongside the origin of sociality in corbiculate bees; these loci could represent gene regulatory elements associated with division of labour within this group. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that gene regulatory innovations are associated with the evolution of eusociality and illustrate how a thorough examination of both coding and non-coding sequence can provide a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioural evolution.This article is part of the theme issue `Convergent evolution in the genomics era: new insights and directions'.},

@article{ruckmanChromosomeNumberEvolves2020,
	Abstract = {Despite the fundamental role of centromeres two different types are observed across plants and animals. Monocentric chromosomes possess a single region that function as the centromere while in holocentric chromosomes centromere activity is spread across the entire chromosome. Proper segregation may fail in species with monocentric chromosomes after a fusion or fission, which may lead to chromosomes with no centromere or multiple centromeres. In contrast, species with holocentric chromosomes should still be able to safely segregate chromosomes after fusion or fission. This along with the observation of high chromosome number in some holocentric clades has led to the hypothesis that holocentricity leads to higher rates of chromosome number evolution. To test for differences in rates of chromosome number evolution between these systems, we analyzed data from 4,393 species of insects in a phylogenetic framework. We found that insect orders exhibit striking differences in rates of fissions, fusions, and polyploidy. However, across all insects we found no evidence that holocentric clades have higher rates of fissions, fusions, or polyploidy than monocentric clades. Our results suggest that holocentricity alone does not lead to higher rates of chromosome number changes. Instead, we suggest that other co-evolving traits must explain striking differences between clades.},

@article{saharaSexChromosomeEvolution2012,
	Abstract = {Lepidoptera, i.e. moths and butterflies, have a female heterogametic sex chromosome system, with most females having a WZ constitution while males are ZZ. Besides this predominant WZ/ZZ system, Z/ZZ, WZ1Z2/Z1Z1Z2Z2 and W1W2Z/ZZ systems also occur. Sex is determined by an unknown W-linked gene or genes in Bombyx mori, but by dosage-dependent and equally unknown Z-linked genes in all Z/ZZ species. The female heterogametic sex chromosome system has been conserved for at least 180~MY in the phylogenetic branch that combines Lepidoptera and Trichoptera. The W chromosome, which is present in most lepidopteran species, was incorporated in the sex chromosome system much later, about 90--100~MY ago. The Z chromosomes are highly conserved among Lepidoptera, much like the Z in birds or the X in mammals. The W, on the other hand, is evolving rapidly. It is crammed with repetitive elements which appear to have a high turnover rate but poor in or even devoid of protein-coding genes. It has frequently undergone fusion with autosomes or sporadically lost altogether.},

@article{scherthanCentromereTelomereMovements1996,
	Abstract = {The preconditions and early steps of meiotic chromosome pairing were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific DNA probes to mouse and human testis tissue sections. Premeiotic pairing of homologous chromosomes was not detected in spermatogonia of the two species. FISH with centromere- and telomere-specific DNA probes in combination with immunostaining (IS) of synaptonemal complex (SC) proteins to testis sections of prepuberal mice at days 4-12 post partum was performed to study sequentially the meiotic pairing process. Movements of centromeres and then telomeres to the nuclear envelope, and of telomeres along the nuclear envelope leading to the formation of a chromosomal bouquet were detected during mouse prophase. At the bouquet stage, pairing of a mouse chromosome-8-specific probe was observed. SC-IS and simultaneous telomere FISH revealed that axial element proteins appear as large aggregates in mouse meiocytes when telomeres are attached to the nuclear envelope. Axial element formation initiates during tight telomere clustering and transverse filament-IS indicated the initiation of synapsis during this stage. Comparison of telomere and centromere distribution patterns of mouse and human meiocytes revealed movements of centromeres and then telomeres to the nuclear envelope and subsequent bouquet formation as conserved motifs of the pairing process. Chromosome painting in human spermatogonia revealed compacted, largely mutually exclusive chromosome territories. The territories developed into long, thin threads at the onset of meiotic prophase. Based on these results a unified model of the pairing process is proposed.},

@article{schwanderSupergenesComplexPhenotypes2014,
	Abstract = {Understanding the molecular underpinnings of evolutionary adaptations is a central focus of modern evolutionary biology. Recent studies have uncovered a panoply of complex phenotypes, including locally adapted ecotypes and cryptic morphs, divergent social behaviours in birds and insects, as well as alternative metabolic pathways in plants and fungi, that are regulated by clusters of tightly linked loci. These `supergenes' segregate as stable polymorphisms within or between natural populations and influence ecologically relevant traits. Some supergenes may span entire chromosomes, because selection for reduced recombination between a supergene and a nearby locus providing additional benefits can lead to locus expansions with dynamics similar to those known for sex chromosomes. In addition to allowing for the co-segregation of adaptive variation within species, supergenes may facilitate the spread of complex phenotypes across species boundaries. Application of new genomic methods is likely to lead to the discovery of many additional supergenes in a broad range of organisms and reveal similar genetic architectures for convergently evolved phenotypes.},

Genomic data are limited in giant sequoia and producing a reference genome sequence has been an important goal to allow marker development for restoration and management. Using deep-coverage Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, combined with Dovetail chromosome conformation capture libraries, the genome was assembled into eleven chromosome-scale scaffolds containing 8.125 Gbp of sequence. Iso-Seq transcripts, assembled from three distinct tissues, was used as evidence to annotate a total of 41,632 protein-coding genes. The genome was found to contain, distributed unevenly across all 11 chromosomes and in 63 orthogroups, over 900 complete or partial predicted NLR genes, of which 375 are supported by annotation derived from protein evidence and gene modeling. This giant sequoia reference genome sequence represents the first genome sequenced in the Cupressaceae family, and lays a foundation for using genomic tools to aid in giant sequoia conservation and management.},

This suggests that changes in the regulatory genome, rather than in gene innovation, were key to the origin of animals. Here, we carry out multiple functional genomic assays in Capsaspora owczarzaki, the unicellular relative of animals with the largest known gene repertoire for transcriptional regulation. We show that changing chromatin states, differential lincRNA expression, and dynamic cis-regulatory sites are associated with life cycle transitions in Capsaspora. Moreover, we demonstrate conservation of animal developmental transcription-factor networks and extensive network interconnection in this premetazoan organism. In contrast, however, Capsaspora lacks animal promoter types, and its regulatory sites are small, proximal, and lack signatures of animal enhancers. Overall, our results indicate that the emergence of animal multicellularity was linked to a major shift in genome cis-regulatory complexity, most notably the appearance of distal enhancer regulation.},

@article{seixasSyntenyBasedGenomeAssembly2021,
	Abstract = {Heliconius butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) are a group of 48 neotropical species widely studied in evolutionary research. Despite the wealth of genomic data generated in past years, chromosomal level genome assemblies currently exist for only two species, Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato, each a representative of one of the two major clades of the genus. Here, we use these reference genomes to improve the contiguity of previously published draft genome assemblies of 16 Heliconius species. Using a reference-assisted scaffolding approach, we place and order the scaffolds of these genomes onto chromosomes, resulting in 95.7--99.9\% of their genomes anchored to chromosomes. Genome sizes are somewhat variable among species (270--422\,Mb) and in one small group of species (Heliconius hecale, Heliconius elevatus, and Heliconius pardalinus) expansions in genome size are driven mainly by repetitive sequences that map to four small regions in the H. melpomene reference genome. Genes from these repeat regions show an increase in exon copy number, an absence of internal stop codons, evidence of constraint on nonsynonymous changes, and increased expression, all of which suggest that at least some of the extra copies are functional. Finally, we conducted a systematic search for inversions and identified five moderately large inversions fixed between the two major Heliconius clades. We infer that one of these inversions was transferred by introgression between the lineages leading to the erato/sara and burneyi/doris clades. These reference-guided assemblies represent a major improvement in Heliconius genomic resources that enable further genetic and evolutionary discoveries in this genus.},

@article{semonRelationshipGeneExpression2005,
	Abstract = {Mammalian chromosomes are characterized by large-scale variations of DNA base composition (the so-called isochores). In contradiction with previous studies, Lercher et al. (Hum. Mol. Genet., 12, 2411, 2003) recently reported a strong correlation between gene expression breadth and GC-content, suggesting that there might be a selective pressure favoring the concentration of housekeeping genes in GC-rich isochores. We reassessed this issue by examining in human and mouse the correlation between gene expression and GC-content, using different measures of gene expression (EST, SAGE and microarray) and different measures of GC-content. We show that correlations between GC-content and expression are very weak, and may vary according to the method used to measure expression. Such weak correlations have a very low predictive value. The strong correlations reported by Lercher et al. (2003) are because of the fact that they measured variables over neighboring genes windows. We show here that using gene windows artificially enhances the correlation. The assertion that the expression of a given gene depends on the GC-content of the region where it is located is therefore not supported by the data.},

@article{senaratneFormationCenH3DeficientHolocentromere2021,
	Abstract = {Despite the essentiality for faithful chromosome segregation, centromere architectures are diverse among eukaryotes1,2 and embody two main configurations: mono- and holocentromeres, referring, respectively, to localized or unrestricted distribution of centromeric activity. Of the two, some holocentromeres offer the curious condition of having arisen independently in multiple insects, most of which have lost the otherwise essential centromere-specifying factor CenH33 (first described as CENP-A in humans).4, 5, 6, 7 The loss of CenH3 raises intuitive questions about how holocentromeres are organized and regulated in CenH3-lacking insects. Here, we report the first chromatin-level description of CenH3-deficient holocentromeres by leveraging recently identified centromere components6,7 and genomics approaches to map and characterize the holocentromeres of the silk moth Bombyx mori, a representative lepidopteran insect lacking CenH3. This uncovered a robust correlation between the distribution of centromere sites and regions of low chromatin activity along B.~mori chromosomes. Transcriptional perturbation experiments recapitulated the exclusion of B.~mori centromeres from active chromatin. Based on reciprocal centromere occupancy patterns observed along differentially expressed orthologous genes of Lepidoptera, we further found that holocentromere formation in a manner that is recessive to chromatin dynamics is evolutionarily conserved. Our results help us discuss the plasticity of centromeres in the context of a role for the chromosome-wide chromatin landscape in conferring centromere identity rather than the presence of CenH3. Given the co-occurrence of CenH3 loss and holocentricity in insects,7 we further propose that the evolutionary establishment of holocentromeres in insects was facilitated through the loss of a CenH3-specified centromere.},

@article{sharpCodonUsageRegulatory1986,
	Abstract = {It has often been suggested that differential usage of codons recognized by rare tRNA species, i.e. "rare codons", represents an evolutionary strategy to modulate gene expression. In particular, regulatory genes are reported to have an extraordinarily high frequency of rare codons. From E. coli we have compiled codon usage data for highly expressed genes, moderately/lowly expressed genes, and regulatory genes. We have identified a clear and general trend in codon usage bias, from the very high bias seen in very highly expressed genes and attributed to selection, to a rather low bias in other genes which seems to be more influenced by mutation than by selection. There is no clear tendency for an increased frequency of rare codons in the regulatory genes, compared to a large group of other moderately/lowly expressed genes with low codon bias. From this, as well as a consideration of evolutionary rates of regulatory genes, and of experimental data on translation rates, we conclude that the pattern of synonymous codon usage in regulatory genes reflects primarily the relaxation of natural selection.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary origins of advanced eusociality, one of the most complex forms of phenotypic plasticity in nature, have long been a focus within the field of sociobiology. Although eusocial insects are known to have evolved from solitary ancestors, sociogenomic research among incipiently social taxa has only recently provided empirical evidence supporting theories that modular regulation and deeply conserved genes may play important roles in both the evolutionary emergence and elaboration of insect sociality. There remains, however, a paucity of data to further test the biological reality of these and other evolutionary theories among taxa in the earliest stages of social evolution. Here, we present brain transcriptomic data from the incipiently social small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata, which captures patterns of cis-regulation and gene expression associated with female maturation, and underlying two well-defined behavioural states, foraging and guarding, concurrently demonstrated by mothers and daughters during early autumn. We find that an incipiently social nest environment may dramatically affect gene expression. We further reveal foraging and guarding behaviours to be putatively caste-antecedent states in C. calcarata, and offer strong empirical support for the operation of modular regulation, involving deeply conserved and differentially expressed genes in the expression of early social forms.},

@article{shenEffectsCertainCisRegulatory2020,
	Abstract = {Bombyx mori vitellogenin (BmVg) is highly upregulated during pupation, and the 20-hydroxyecdysone and amino acids may regulate stage-specific BmVg expression. However, previous studies showed that other factors may also affect stage-specific BmVg expression. Here, we characterized effective BmVg transcription factors by identifying the corresponding cis-regulatory elements (CREs). We prepared transgenic B. mori, in which DsRed was driven by various lengths of BmVg promoter. qRT-PCR analysis showed that DsRed expression driven by a 1.0-kb BmVg promoter (VgP1.0K) was consistent with endogenous BmVg. VgP1.0K specificity was closer to the endogenous BmVg promoter than that of VgP0.8K. These results suggest that CREs affecting stage-specific BmVg expression were localized to the 1.0-kb BmVg promoter. We investigated the effects of certain CREs that could influence the stage specificity of BmVg promoter on BmVg expression in transgenic B. mori.The relative DsRed expression was significantly reduced in transgenic female B. mori and the peak in DsRed expression was delayed after E-box CRE mutation. These results demonstrate that the E-box element enhanced BmVg expression and also affected stagespecific BmVg expression. Moreover, the relative DsRed expression was significantly increased in transgenic female of B. mori after 3×BD CRE mutation in BmVg promoter. However, the stage specificity of the mutated promoter was consistent with that of the endogenous BmVg promoter.The 3×BD element downregulated BmVg but had no effect on stage-specific BmVg expression.The present study promoted the process of elucidating the regulatory network for stage-specific BmVg expression and furnished a theoretical basis for the application of BmVg promoter.},

Until now, the Balkan Peninsula remained one of the major unknowns in terms of distribution, genetic structure, and ecological preferences of the Leptidea triplet in Europe. We present new molecular and morphological data from a detailed survey of the region. Our DNA analysis suggests that the Balkan populations belong only to L. sinapis and L. juvernica, and that they are not genetically differentiated from other mainland populations. The distribution data reveal that L. sinapis is a widespread habitat generalist, while L. juvernica exhibits a transition from a habitat generalist in the western Balkans to a localised habitat specialist, confined to humid mountain habitats, in the east. The morphometric analysis of male genitalia and a comparison to data from other parts of the species' ranges suggest an interesting mosaic of regional morphological variation that is likely linked to environmental and ecological factors. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the genitalia scaling relations for analysing the morphological variation and discuss the implications for species identification.},

@article{simonUsingFormaldehydeassistedIsolation2012,
	Abstract = {Eviction or destabilization of nucleosomes from chromatin is a hallmark of functional regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes. Historically identified by nuclease hypersensitivity, these regulatory elements are typically bound by transcription factors or other regulatory proteins. FAIRE (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements) is an alternative approach to identify these genomic regions and has proven successful in a multitude of eukaryotic cell and tissue types. Cells or dissociated tissues are cross-linked briefly with formaldehyde, lysed and sonicated. Sheared chromatin is subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and the isolated DNA, typically encompassing 1--3\% of the human genome, is purified. We provide guidelines for quantitative analysis by PCR, microarrays or next-generation sequencing. Regulatory elements enriched by FAIRE have high concordance with those identified by nuclease hypersensitivity or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and the entire procedure can be completed in 3 d. FAIRE has low technical variability, which allows its usage in large-scale studies of chromatin from normal or diseased tissues.},

@article{sissonLavaLampNovel2000,
	Abstract = {Drosophila cellularization and animal cell cytokinesis rely on the coordinated functions of the microfilament and microtubule cytoskeletal systems. To identify new proteins involved in cellularization and cytokinesis, we have conducted a biochemical screen for microfilament/microtubule-associated proteins (MMAPs). 17 MMAPs were identified; seven have been previously implicated in cellularization and/or cytokinesis, including KLP3A, Anillin, Septins, and Dynamin. We now show that a novel MMAP, Lava Lamp (Lva), is also required for cellularization. Lva is a coiled-coil protein and, unlike other proteins previously implicated in cellularization or cytokinesis, it is Golgi associated. Our functional analysis shows that cellularization is dramatically inhibited upon injecting anti--Lva antibodies (IgG and Fab) into embryos. In addition, we show that brefeldin A, a potent inhibitor of membrane trafficking, also inhibits cellularization. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Lva physically interacts with the MMAPs Spectrin and CLIP190. We suggest that Lva and Spectrin may form a Golgi-based scaffold that mediates the interaction of Golgi bodies with microtubules and facilitates Golgi-derived membrane secretion required for the formation of furrows during cellularization. Our results are consistent with the idea that animal cell cytokinesis depends on both actomyosin-based contraction and Golgi-derived membrane secretion.},

	Abstract = {During scientific investigations, the explanation of remarkably interesting phenomena must often await development of new methods or accrual of new observations that in retrospect can lead to lucid answers to the initial problem. A case in point is the control of genetic recombination during meiosis, which leads to crossovers between chromosomes critical for production of healthy offspring. Crossovers must be properly placed along meiotic chromosomes for their accurate segregation. Here, we review observations on two aspects of meiotic crossover control -- crossover interference and repression of crossovers near centromeres, both observed more than 85 years ago. Only recently have relatively simple molecular mechanisms for these phenomena become clear through advances in both methods and understanding the molecular basis of meiotic recombination.},

Here, we provide a chromosome-level assembly of the butterfly's genome produced from Pacific Biosciences sequencing of a pool of males, combined with a linkage map from population crosses. RESULTS: The final assembly size of 484 Mb is an increase of 94 Mb on the previously published genome. Estimation of the completeness of the genome with BUSCO indicates that the genome contains 92-94\% of the BUSCO genes in complete and single copies. We predicted 14,810 genes using the MAKER pipeline and manually curated 1,232 of these gene models. CONCLUSIONS: The genome and its annotated gene models are a valuable resource for future comparative genomics, molecular biology, transcriptome, and genetics studies on this species.},

@article{srygleyOptimalStrategiesInsects2008,
	Abstract = {Directed aerial displacement requires that a volant organism's airspeed exceeds ambient wind speed. For biologically relevant altitudes, wind speed increases exponentially with increased height above the ground. Thus, dispersal of most insects is influenced by atmospheric conditions. However, insects that fly close to the Earth's surface displace within the flight boundary layer where insect airspeeds are relatively high. Over the past 17 years, we have studied boundary-layer insects by following individuals as they migrate across the Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal. Although most migrants evade either drought or cold, nymphalid and pierid butterflies migrate across Panama near the onset of the rainy season. Dragonflies of the genus Pantala migrate in October concurrently with frontal weather systems. Migrating the furthest and thereby being the most difficult to study, the diurnal moth Urania fulgens migrates between Central and South America. Migratory butterflies and dragonflies are capable of directed movement towards a preferred compass direction in variable winds, whereas the moths drift with winds over water. Butterflies orient using both global and local cues. Consistent with optimal migration theory, butterflies and dragonflies adjust their flight speeds in ways that maximize migratory distance traveled per unit fuel, whereas the moths do not. Moreover, only butterflies adjust their flight speed in relation to endogenous fat reserves. It is likely that these insects use optic flow to gauge their speed and drift, and thus must migrate where sufficient detail in the Earth's surface is visible to them. The abilities of butterflies and dragonflies to adjust their airspeed over water indicate sophisticated control and guidance systems pertaining to migration.},

During feeding they release chemical cues that allow plants to detect the attack and mount an efficient defense response. A signaling cascade triggers the expression of hundreds of genes, which encode defensive proteins and enzymes for synthesis of toxic metabolites. This direct defense is often complemented by emission of volatiles that attract beneficial parasitoids. In return, arthropods have evolved strategies to interfere with plant defenses, either by producing effectors to inhibit detection and downstream signaling steps, or by adapting to their detrimental effect. In this review, we address the current knowledge on the molecular and chemical dialog between plants and herbivores, with an emphasis on co-evolutionary aspects.},

@article{stapleyVariationRecombinationFrequency2017,
	Abstract = {Recombination, the exchange of DNA between maternal and paternal chromosomes during meiosis, is an essential feature of sexual reproduction in nearly all multicellular organisms. While the role of recombination in the evolution of sex has received theoretical and empirical attention, less is known about how recombination rate itself evolves and what influence this has on evolutionary processes within sexually reproducing organisms. Here, we explore the patterns of, and processes governing recombination in eukaryotes. We summarize patterns of variation, integrating current knowledge with an analysis of linkage map data in 353 organisms. We then discuss proximate and ultimate processes governing recombination rate variation and consider how these influence evolutionary processes. Genome-wide recombination rates (cM/Mb) can vary more than tenfold across eukaryotes, and there is large variation in the distribution of recombination events across closely related taxa, populations and individuals. We discuss how variation in rate and distribution relates to genome architecture, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, sex, environmental perturbations and variable selective pressures. There has been great progress in determining the molecular mechanisms governing recombination, and with the continued development of new modelling and empirical approaches, there is now also great opportunity to further our understanding of how and why recombination rate varies.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation in sexual organisms'.},

@article{stefanescuLongdistanceAutumnMigration2016,
	Abstract = {The painted lady, Vanessa cardui, is a migratory butterfly that performs an annual multi-generational migration between Europe and North Africa. Its seasonal appearance south of the Sahara in autumn is well known and has led to the suggestion that it results from extremely long migratory flights by European butterflies to seasonally exploit the Sahel and the tropical savannah. However, this possibility has remained unproven. Here, we analyse the isotopic composition of butterflies from seven European and seven African countries to provide new support for this hypothesis. Each individual was assigned a geographical natal origin, based on its wing stable hydrogen isotope (δ2Hw) value and a predicted δ2Hw basemap for Europe and northern Africa. Natal assignments of autumn migrants collected south of the Sahara confirmed long-distance movements (of 4000 km or more) starting in Europe. Samples from Maghreb revealed a mixed origin of migrants, with most individuals with a European origin, but others having originated in the Sahel. Therefore, autumn movements are not only directed to northwestern Africa, but also include southward and northward flights across the Sahara. Through this remarkable behaviour, the productive but highly seasonal region south of the Sahara is incorporated into the migratory circuit of V. cardui.},

@article{stefanescuMultigenerationalLongdistanceMigration2013,
	Abstract = {Long-range, seasonal migration is a widespread phenomenon among insects, allowing them to track and exploit abundant but ephemeral resources over vast geographical areas. However, the basic patterns of how species shift across multiple locations and seasons are unknown in most cases, even though migrant species comprise an important component of the temperate-zone biota. The painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui is such an example; a cosmopolitan continuously-brooded species which migrates each year between Africa and Europe, sometimes in enormous numbers. The migration of 2009 was one of the most impressive recorded, and thousands of observations were collected through citizen science programmes and systematic entomological surveys, such as high altitude insect-monitoring radar and ground-based butterfly monitoring schemes. Here we use V. cardui as a model species to better understand insect migration in the Western Palaearctic, and we capitalise on the complementary data sources available for this iconic butterfly. The migratory cycle in this species involves six generations, encompassing a latitudinal shift of thousands of kilometres (up to 60 degrees of latitude). The cycle comprises an annual poleward advance of the populations in spring followed by an equatorward return movement in autumn, with returning individuals potentially flying thousands of kilometres. We show that many long-distance migrants take advantage of favourable winds, moving downwind at high elevation (from some tens of metres from the ground to altitudes over 1000 m), pointing at strong similarities in the flight strategies used by V. cardui and other migrant Lepidoptera. Our results reveal the highly successful strategy that has evolved in these insects, and provide a useful framework for a better understanding of long-distance seasonal migration in the temperate regions worldwide.},

@article{stefanescuTimingMatingReproductive2021,
	Abstract = {In many migratory insects, migration occurs during the prereproductive phase of the life cycle. This trait probably arises from a trade-off between migration and reproduction and in females has been termed the `oogenesis--flight syndrome'. However, the generality of this syndrome has been questioned, especially for monomorphic insects. We studied the relationship between migration and reproduction in the highly cosmopolitan painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, which in the Palaearctic undertakes the longest known multigenerational migration circuit of any insect. We tested for the oogenesis--flight syndrome in both spring and autumn migrants in two regions linked by migration, North Africa and northern Spain. Field observations were combined with laboratory experiments to determine the life span and the age at first mating to unravel the reproductive strategy observed in wild-caught individuals. Females and males wait on average around 5--6 days before mating, and field data revealed that mating frequencies increased rapidly once females reached a medium wing wear category. There were seasonal differences in mating frequencies in the study regions depending on whether the region acted as a source or as a destination for migrants, and in the latter case there were almost twice as many mated females. Moreover, a great majority of females collected during migratory flights were unmated, the remaining females having mated only very recently. Our results thus strongly indicate that the painted lady fulfils the oogenesis--flight syndrome, as migration is concentrated in its relatively short prereproductive period. Field data also showed a high positive correlation between mating frequency and host plant abundance, which suggests that mated females are able to locate potential breeding areas. This, together with the high fecundity estimated in laboratory trials, makes the painted lady a highly successful migratory insect.},

@article{steinGenomeSequenceCaenorhabditis2003,
	Abstract = {The soil nematodes Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans diverged from a common ancestor roughly 100 million years ago and yet are almost indistinguishable by eye. They have the same chromosome number and genome sizes, and they occupy the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure and function, we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the finished C. elegans sequence. We predict approximately 19,500 protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae genome, roughly the same as in C. elegans. Of these, 12,200 have clear C. elegans orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly detectable C. elegans homologs, and approximately 800 C. briggsae genes have no detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity, and the rate of divergence appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers. Operons, a distinctive feature of C. elegans, are highly conserved in C. briggsae, with the arrangement of genes being preserved in 96\% of cases. The difference in size between the C. briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive sequence, which accounts for 22.4\% of the C. briggsae genome in contrast to 16.5\% of the C. elegans genome. Few, if any, repeat families are shared, suggesting that most were acquired after the two species diverged or are undergoing rapid evolution. Coclustering the C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins reveals 2,169 protein families of two or more members. Most of these are shared between the two species, but some appear to be expanding or contracting, and there seem to be as many as several hundred novel C. briggsae gene families. The C. briggsae draft sequence will greatly improve the annotation of the C. elegans genome. Based on similarity to C. briggsae, we found strong evidence for 1,300 new C. elegans genes. In addition, comparisons of the two genomes will help to understand the evolutionary forces that mold nematode genomes.},

@article{stepienRNAbindingProfilesDrosophila2016,
	Abstract = {Localized protein translation is critical in many biological contexts, particularly in highly polarized cells, such as neurons, to regulate gene expression in a spatiotemporal manner. The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding (CPEB) family of RNA-binding proteins has emerged as a key regulator of mRNA transport and local translation required for early embryonic development, synaptic plasticity, and long-term memory (LTM).               Drosophila               Orb and Orb2 are single members of the CPEB1 and CPEB2 subfamilies of the CPEB proteins, respectively. At present, the identity of the mRNA targets they regulate is not fully known, and the binding specificity of the CPEB2 subfamily is a matter of debate. Using transcriptome-wide UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, we define the mRNA-binding sites and targets of               Drosophila               CPEBs. Both Orb and Orb2 bind linear cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-like sequences in the 3′ UTRs of largely overlapping target mRNAs, with Orb2 potentially having a broader specificity. Both proteins use their RNA-recognition motifs but not the Zinc-finger region for RNA binding. A subset of Orb2 targets is translationally regulated in cultured S2 cells and fly head extracts. Moreover, pan-neuronal RNAi knockdown of these targets suggests that a number of these targets are involved in LTM. Our results provide a comprehensive list of mRNA targets of the two CPEB proteins in               Drosophila               , thus providing insights into local protein synthesis involved in various biological processes, including LTM.},

@article{talaveraDiscoveryMassMigration2016,
	Abstract = {Migratory behaviour has repeatedly evolved across taxa as an adaptation to heterogeneity in space and time. However, insect migration is still poorly understood, partly because of the lack of field data. The painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui undertakes a long-distance annual migration between Europe and Africa. While spring flights from the Maghreb to Europe are well characterized, it is not known how far the European autumn migrants travel into Africa and whether they massively cross the Sahara Desert. We conducted fieldwork in four African countries (Chad, Benin, Senegal, and Ethiopia) in autumn and documented southward migrants in central Chad and abundant breeding sites across the tropical savannah as far south as the Niger River in the west and the Ethiopian highlands in the east. Given directionality and timing, these migrants probably originated in Europe and crossed the Mediterranean, the Sahara and the Sahel, a hypothesis that implies the longest ({$>$}4000 km) migratory flight recorded for a butterfly in a single generation. In the light of the new evidence, we revise the prevailing spatiotemporal model for the annual migration of V. cardui to incorporate tropical Africa, which could potentially be regarded as the missing geographic link between autumn (southwards) and spring (northwards) movements.},

	Abstract = {The Palearctic--African migratory circuit has been typically associated with birds. Very few insects are known to endure annual trans-Saharan circuits, but the Painted Lady butterfly (               Vanessa cardui               ) is an exception. While it was demonstrated that this species massively migrates from Europe to the Afrotropics during the autumn, the existence of a reverse migration from the Afrotropics to Europe in the early spring remains hypothetical. Here, we analysed wing stable hydrogen isotope values (δ               2               H) of               V. cardui               migrants collected from February to April across the circum-Mediterranean region. We assessed their region of natal origin by comparing their wing isotope signature predicted δ               2               H values (isoscape). The results unambiguously demonstrate a sub-Saharan origin for many individuals, especially those collected in February, representing the first tangible evidence for a reverse northwards trans-Saharan migration in spring. This work supports the view that the Afrotropics (mostly exploited from September to February) is key in the               V. cardui               Palearctic--African population dynamics. This species relies on both temperate and tropical habitats to complete their multigenerational cycle, an unprecedented adaptation for butterflies and for most migratory insects. Such a migratory circuit has strong parallelisms with those of migratory birds.},

@article{tallaDissectingEffectsSelection2019,
	Abstract = {The relative role of natural selection and genetic drift in evolution is a major topic of debate in evolutionary biology. Most knowledge spring from a small group of organisms and originate from before it was possible to generate genome-wide data on genetic variation. Hence, it is necessary to extend to a larger number of taxonomic groups, descriptive and hypothesis-based research aiming at understanding the proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying both levels of genetic polymorphism and the efficiency of natural selection. In this study, we used data from 60 whole-genome resequenced individuals of three cryptic butterfly species (Leptidea sp.), together with novel gene annotation information and population recombination data. We characterized the overall prevalence of natural selection and investigated the effects of mutation and linked selection on regional variation in nucleotide diversity. Our analyses showed that genome-wide diversity and rate of adaptive substitutions were comparatively low, whereas nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism and substitution levels were comparatively high in Leptidea, suggesting small long-term effective population sizes. Still, negative selection on linked sites (background selection) has resulted in reduced nucleotide diversity in regions with relatively high gene density and low recombination rate. We also found a significant effect of mutation rate variation on levels of polymorphism. Finally, there were considerable population differences in levels of genetic diversity and pervasiveness of selection against slightly deleterious alleles, in line with expectations from differences in estimated effective population sizes.},

@article{tallaRapidIncreaseGenome2017,
	Abstract = {Characterizing and quantifying genome size variation among organisms and understanding if genome size evolves as a consequence of adaptive or stochastic processes have been long-standing goals in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigate genome size variation and association with transposable elements (TEs) across lepidopteran lineages using a novel genome assembly of the common wood-white (Leptidea sinapis) and population re-sequencing data from both L. sinapis and the closely related L. reali and L. juvernica together with 12 previously available lepidopteran genome assemblies. A phylogenetic analysis confirms established relationships among species, but identifies previously unknown intraspecific structure within Leptidea lineages. The genome assembly of L. sinapis is one of the largest of any lepidopteran taxon so far (643 Mb) and genome size is correlated with abundance of TEs, both in Lepidoptera in general and within Leptidea where L. juvernica from Kazakhstan has considerably larger genome size than any other Leptidea population. Specific TE subclasses have been active in different Lepidoptera lineages with a pronounced expansion of predominantly LINEs, DNA elements, and unclassified TEs in the Leptidea lineage after the split from other Pieridae. The rate of genome expansion in Leptidea in general has been in the range of four Mb/Million year (My), with an increase in a particular L. juvernica population to 72 Mb/My. The considerable differences in accumulation rates of specific TE classes in different lineages indicate that TE activity plays a major role in genome size evolution in butterflies and moths.},

@article{tanLTRmediatedRetropositionMechanism2016,
	Abstract = {In a broad range of taxa, genes can duplicate through an RNA intermediate in a process mediated by retrotransposons (retroposition). In mammals, L1 retrotransposons drive retroposition, but the elements responsible for retroposition in other animals have yet to be identified. Here, we examined young retrocopies from various animals that still retain the sequence features indicative of the underlying retroposition mechanism. In Drosophila melanogaster, we identified and de novo assembled 15 polymorphic retrocopies and found that all retroposed loci are chimeras of internal retrocopies flanked by discontinuous LTR retrotransposons. At the fusion points between the mRNAs and the LTR retrotransposons, we identified shared short similar sequences that suggest the involvement of microsimilarity-dependent template switches. By expanding our approach to mosquito, zebrafish, chicken, and mammals, we identified in all these species recently originated retrocopies with a similar chimeric structure and shared microsimilarities at the fusion points. We also identified several retrocopies that combine the sequences of two or more parental genes, demonstrating LTR-retroposition as a novel mechanism of exon shuffling. Finally, we found that LTR-mediated retrocopies are immediately cotranscribed with their flanking LTR retrotransposons. Transcriptional profiling coupled with sequence analyses revealed that the sense-strand transcription of the retrocopies often lead to the origination of in-frame proteins relative to the parental genes. Overall, our data show that LTR-mediated retroposition is highly conserved across a wide range of animal taxa; combined with previous work from plants and yeast, it represents an ancient and ongoing mechanism continuously shaping gene content evolution in eukaryotes.},

@article{tileyRelationshipRecombinationRate2015,
	Abstract = {Although homologous recombination affects the efficacy of selection in populations, the pattern of recombination rate evolution and its effects on genome evolution across plants are largely unknown. Recombination can reduce genome size by enabling the removal of LTR retrotransposons, alter codon usage by GC biased gene conversion, contribute to complex histories of gene duplication and loss through tandem duplication, and enhance purifying selection on genes. Therefore, variation in recombination rate across species may explain some of the variation in genomic architecture as well as rates of molecular evolution. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the evolution of global meiotic recombination rate in angiosperms and its effects on genome architecture and selection at the molecular level using genetic maps and genome sequences from thirty angiosperm species.},

	Abstract = {We report the first genetic linkage map of Heliconius erato, a species that shows remarkable variation in its warningly colored wing patterns. We use crosses between H. erato and its sister species, H. himera, to place two major color pattern genes, D and Cr, on a linkage map containing AFLP, allozyme, microsatellite and single-copy nuclear loci. We identified all 21 linkage groups in an initial genetic screen of 22 progeny from an F1 female × male H. himera family. Of the 229 markers, 87 used to identify linkage groups were also informative in 35 progeny from a sibling backcross (H. himera female × F1 male). With these, and an additional 33 markers informative in the second family, we constructed recombinational maps for 19 of the 21 linkage groups. These maps varied in length from 18.1 to 431.1 centimorgans (cM) and yielded an estimated total length of 2400\,cM. The average distance between markers was 23\,cM, and eight of the 19 linkage groups, including the sex chromosome (Z) and the chromosome containing the Cr locus, contained two or more codominant anchor loci. Of the three potential candidate genes mapped here, Cubitus interruptus (Ci), Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wingless (Wg), only Ci was linked, although loosely, to a known Heliconius color pattern locus. This work is an important first step for constructing a denser genetic map of the H. erato color pattern radiation and for a comparative genomic study of the architecture of mimicry in Heliconius butterflies.},

	Abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are central to the function and evolution of genes and gene regulation. At the organismal level, enhancers play a crucial role in coordinating tissue- and context-dependent gene expression. At the population level, changes in enhancers are thought to be a major driving force that facilitates evolution of diverse traits. An amazing array of diverse traits seen in insect morphology, physiology and behavior has been the subject of research for centuries. Although enhancer studies in insects outside of Drosophila have been limited, recent advances in functional genomic approaches have begun to make such studies possible in an increasing selection of insect species. Here, instead of comprehensively reviewing currently available technologies for enhancer studies in established model organisms such as Drosophila, we focus on a subset of computational and experimental approaches that are likely applicable to nonDrosophila insects, and discuss the pros and cons of each approach. We discuss the importance of validating enhancer function and evaluate several possible validation methods, such as reporter assays and genome editing. Key points and potential pitfalls when establishing a reporter assay system in non-traditional insect models are also discussed. We close with a discussion of how to advance enhancer studies in insects, both by improving computational approaches and by expanding the genetic toolbox in various insects. Through these discussions, this Review provides a conceptual framework for studying the function and evolution of enhancers in non-traditional insect models.},

It includes several species used as rootstock for their resistance to various abiotic and biotic stressors. We present the full structural and functional genome annotations of six Juglans species and one outgroup within Juglandaceae (Juglans regia, J. cathayensis, J. hindsii, J. microcarpa, J. nigra, J. sigillata and Pterocarya stenoptera) produced using BRAKER2 semi-unsupervised gene prediction pipeline and additional tools. For each annotation, gene predictors were trained using 19 tissue-specific J. regia transcriptomes aligned to the genomes. Additional functional evidence and filters were applied to multi-exonic and mono-exonic putative genes to yield between 27 000 and 44 000 high-confidence gene models per species. Comparison of gene models to the BUSCO embryophyta dataset suggested that, on average, genome annotation completeness was 85.6\%. We utilized these high-quality annotations to assess gene family evolution within Juglans, and among Juglans and selected Eurosid species. We found notable contractions in several gene families in J. hindsii, including disease resistance-related wall-associated kinase (WAK), Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase (CrRLK1L) and others involved in abiotic stress response. Finally, we confirmed an ancient whole-genome duplication that took place in a common ancestor of Juglandaceae using site substitution comparative analysis.},

@article{tunstromComplexInterplayBalancing2021,
	Abstract = {Alternative life-history strategies (ALHS) are genetic polymorphisms generating phenotypes differing in life histories that generally arise due to metabolic resource allocation tradeoffs. Althouigh ALHS are often be limited to a single sex or populations of a species, they can, in rare cases, be found among several species across a genus. In the butterfly genus Colias, at least a third of the species have a female limited ALHS called Alba. While many females develop brightly pigmented wings, Alba females reallocate nitrogen resources used in pigment synthesis to reproductive development, producing white-winged, more fecund females. Whether this ALHS evolved once or many times, and whether it has moved among species via introgression or been maintained via long-term balancing selection, has not been established. Answering these questions presents an opportunity to investigate the genetic basis and evolutionary forces acting upon ALHS, which have rarely been studied at a genus level. Here we identify the genetic locus of Alba in a second Colias species, allowing us to compare this with previous results in a larger phylogenetic context. Our findings suggest Alba has a singular origin and has been maintained in Colias through a combination of balancing selection and introgression for nearly one million years and at least as many generations. Finally, using CRISPR/Cas9 deletions in the cis-regulatory region of the Alba allele, we demonstrate that the Alba allele is a modular enhancer for the BarH1 gene and is necessary for the induction of the ALHS, which potentially facilitates its long-term persistence in the genus.},

	Abstract = {Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA sequences can alter gene expression, organismal phenotype and fitness1--3. Constructing complete fitness landscapes, in which DNA sequences are mapped to fitness, is a long-standing goal in biology, but has remained elusive because it is challenging to generalize reliably to vast sequence spaces4--6. Here we build sequence-to-expression models that capture fitness landscapes and use them to decipher principles of regulatory evolution. Using millions of randomly sampled promoter DNA sequences and their measured expression levels in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we learn deep neural network models that generalize with excellent prediction performance, and enable sequence design for expression engineering. Using our models, we study expression divergence under genetic drift and strong-selection weak-mutation regimes to find that regulatory evolution is rapid and subject to diminishing returns epistasis; that conflicting expression objectives in different environments constrain expression adaptation; and that stabilizing selection on gene expression leads to the moderation of regulatory complexity. We present an approach for using such~models to detect signatures of selection on expression from natural variation in regulatory sequences and use it to discover an instance of convergent regulatory evolution. We assess mutational robustness, finding that regulatory mutation effect sizes follow a power law, characterize regulatory evolvability, visualize promoter fitness landscapes, discover evolvability archetypes and illustrate the mutational robustness of natural regulatory sequence populations. Our work provides a general framework for designing regulatory~sequences and~addressing fundamental questions in regulatory evolution.},

In Heliconius butterflies, a small number of genes control the development of diverse wing colour patterns. Here, we used full-genome sequencing of individuals across the Heliconius erato radiation and closely related species to characterize genomic variation associated with wing pattern diversity. We show that variation around colour pattern genes is highly modular, with narrow genomic intervals associated with specific differences in colour and pattern. This modular architecture explains the diversity of colour patterns and provides a flexible mechanism for rapid morphological diversification.},

	Abstract = {Developmental plasticity allows genomes to encode multiple distinct phenotypes that can be differentially manifested in response to environmental cues. Alternative plastic phenotypes can be selected through a process called genetic assimilation, although the mechanisms are still poorly understood. We assimilated a seasonal wing color phenotype in a naturally plastic population of butterflies (               Junonia coenia               ) and characterized three responsible genes. Endocrine assays and chromatin accessibility and conformation analyses showed that the transition of wing coloration from an environmentally determined trait to a predominantly genetic trait occurred through selection for regulatory alleles of downstream wing-patterning genes. This mode of genetic evolution is likely favored by selection because it allows tissue- and trait-specific tuning of reaction norms without affecting core cue detection or transduction mechanisms.},

@article{vankurenButterflyMimicryPolymorphisms2019,
	Abstract = {Abstract             Some genes have repeatedly been found to control diverse adaptations in a wide variety of organisms. Such gene reuse reveals not only the diversity of phenotypes these unique genes control but also the composition of developmental gene networks and the genetic routes available to and taken by organisms during adaptation. However, the causes of gene reuse remain unclear. A small number of large-effect Mendelian loci control a huge diversity of mimetic butterfly wing color patterns, but reasons for their reuse are difficult to identify because the genetic basis of mimicry has primarily been studied in two systems with correlated factors: female-limited Batesian mimicry in Papilio swallowtails (Papilionidae) and non-sex-limited M{\"u}llerian mimicry in Heliconius longwings (Nymphalidae). Here, we break the correlation between phylogenetic relationship and sex-limited mimicry by identifying loci controlling female-limited mimicry polymorphism Hypolimnas misippus (Nymphalidae) and non-sex-limited mimicry polymorphism in Papilio clytia (Papilionidae). The Papilio clytia polymorphism is controlled by the genome region containing the gene cortex, the classic P supergene in Heliconius numata, and loci controlling color pattern variation across Lepidoptera. In contrast, female-limited mimicry polymorphism in Hypolimnas misippus is associated with a locus not previously implicated in color patterning. Thus, although many species repeatedly converged on cortex and its neighboring genes over 120 My of evolution of diverse color patterns, female-limited mimicry polymorphisms each evolved using a different gene. Our results support conclusions that gene reuse occurs mainly within ∼10 My and highlight the puzzling diversity of genes controlling seemingly complex female-limited mimicry polymorphisms.},

However, the importance of these interactions is still poorly understood. Few studies have focused on a closely related group of insect species, to test the similarities and differences between their microbiota. Heliconius butterflies are a charismatic recent insect radiation that evolved the unique ability to use pollen as a protein source, which affected life history traits and resulted in an elevated speciation rates. We hypothesize that different Heliconius butterflies sharing a similar trophic pollen niche, harbor a similar gut flora within species, population and sexes.},

@article{vanthofIndustrialMelanismMutation2016,
	Abstract = {Discovering the mutational events that fuel adaptation to environmental change remains an important challenge for evolutionary biology. The classroom example of a visible evolutionary response is industrial melanism in the peppered moth (Biston betularia): the replacement, during the Industrial Revolution, of the common pale typica form by a previously unknown black (carbonaria) form, driven by the interaction between bird predation and coal pollution. The carbonaria locus has been coarsely localized to a 200-kilobase region, but the specific identity and nature of the sequence difference controlling the carbonaria-typica polymorphism, and the gene it influences, are unknown. Here we show that the mutation event giving rise to industrial melanism in Britain was the insertion of a large, tandemly repeated, transposable element into the first intron of the gene cortex. Statistical inference based on the distribution of recombined carbonaria haplotypes indicates that this transposition event occurred around 1819, consistent with the historical record. We have begun to dissect the mode of action of the carbonaria transposable element by showing that it increases the abundance of a cortex transcript, the protein product of which plays an important role in cell-cycle regulation, during early wing disc development. Our findings fill a substantial knowledge gap in the iconic example of microevolutionary change, adding a further layer of insight into the mechanism of adaptation in response to natural selection. The discovery that the mutation itself is a transposable element will stimulate further debate about the importance of 'jumping genes' as a source of major phenotypic novelty.},

	Abstract = {Small populations are often exposed to high inbreeding and mutational load that can increase the risk of extinction. The Sumatran rhinoceros was widespread in Southeast Asia, but is now restricted to small and isolated populations on Sumatra and Borneo, and most likely extinct on the Malay Peninsula. Here, we analyse 5 historical and 16 modern genomes from these populations to investigate the genomic consequences of the recent decline, such as increased inbreeding and mutational load. We find that the Malay Peninsula population experienced increased inbreeding shortly before extirpation, which possibly was accompanied by purging. The populations on Sumatra and Borneo instead show low inbreeding, but high mutational load. The currently small population sizes may thus in the near future lead to inbreeding depression. Moreover, we find little evidence for differences in local adaptation among populations, suggesting that future inbreeding depression could potentially be mitigated by assisted gene flow among populations.},

@article{wahlbergVagilityVanessaLepidoptera2011,
	Abstract = {Allopatric speciation is thought to occur in the absence of gene flow, thereby suggesting that widespread vagile species might be less likely to generate restricted sister taxa because of a lack of isolation. The butterfly genus Vanessa provides an ideal test of this concept, as it contains some of the most cosmopolitan and vagile species of butterflies on the planet, as well as some highly restricted taxa. Given the age of these groups, this arrangement offers a special opportunity to examine the relationship between vagility and phylogeny in generating novel taxa; specifically, does the vagility of some lineages impede allopatric speciation, leaving restricted clades more speciose? A phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed for all species belonging to the butterfly genus Vanessa based on DNA sequences from one mitochondrial and eight nuclear gene regions. The resulting topology shows very little conflict among gene regions, with five well-supported clades corresponding to morphologically consistent species groups. The data very strongly indicate a polyphyletic genus Antanartia, and thus to preserve monophyly two species previously assigned to Antanartia are transferred to Vanessa, Vanessa hippomenecomb.n. and Vanessa dimorphicacomb.n., resulting in a total of 22 species placed in Vanessa. A biogeographical analysis shows that in many cases the most geographically restricted species are sister to geographically widespread species, suggesting dispersal and allopatric speciation. Surprisingly, in almost all cases the divergences between widespread and restricted species are quite old ({$>$}5 Ma), suggesting long-term isolation and stability of both vagile and sedentary species, despite the high (even intercontinental) vagility of many extant species and, by extension, ancestral species. The biogeography of Vanessa suggests that species vagility and allopatry do not fully explain the forces governing cladogenesis in this remarkable genus.},

@article{wallbankEvolutionaryNoveltyButterfly2016,
	Abstract = {An important goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the genetic changes underlying novel morphological structures. We investigated the origins of a complex wing pattern found among Amazonian Heliconius butterflies. Genome sequence data from 142 individuals across 17 species identified narrow regions associated with two distinct red colour pattern elements, dennis and ray. We hypothesise that these modules in non-coding sequence represent distinct cis-regulatory loci that control expression of the transcription factor optix, which in turn controls red pattern variation across Heliconius. Phylogenetic analysis of the two elements demonstrated that they have distinct evolutionary histories and that novel adaptive morphological variation was created by shuffling these cis-regulatory modules through recombination between divergent lineages. In addition, recombination of modules into different combinations within species further contributes to diversity. Analysis of the timing of diversification in these two regions supports the hypothesis of introgression moving regulatory modules between species, rather than shared ancestral variation. The dennis phenotype introgressed into Heliconius melpomene at about the same time that ray originated in this group, while ray introgressed back into H. elevatus much more recently. We show that shuffling of existing enhancer elements both within and between species provides a mechanism for rapid diversification and generation of novel morphological combinations during adaptive radiation.},

@article{wangConservedRNACiselements2014,
	Abstract = {Doublesex (dsx) is a downstream key regulator in insect sex determination pathway. In Drosophila, alternative splicing of Dm-dsx gene is sex-specifically regulated by transformer (tra), in which the functional TRA promotes female-specific Dm-dsx. However, the sex determination pathway in Lepidoptera is not well understood; here we focused on alternative splicing of doublesex (dsx) in two agricultural pests, Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) and cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), as well as the silkworm (Bombyx mori). More than a dozen new alternative splicing isoforms of dsx were found in the Lepidopteran females, which exist in all tested developmental stages and differentiated tissues. Alignment of mRNA and protein sequences of doublesex revealed high conservation of this gene in Lepidoptera. Strength analysis of splice sites revealed a weak 50 splice site at intron 3 in Lepidopteran dsx, which was experimentally confirmed. Furthermore, we identified highly conserved RNA sequences in the Lepidopteran dsx, including RNA elements I (14 nt), II (11 nt), III (26 nt), IV (17 nt), 3E-1 (8 nt) and 3E-2 (8 nt). The RNA elements III and IV were previously found in exon 4 of B. mori dsx and bound with Bm-PSI, which suppressed the inclusion of exons 3 \& 4 into the male-specific Bm-dsx. Then we identified and analyzed the homologous genes of Bm-psi in the two Lepidopteran pests, which expressed at similar levels and exhibited a unique isoform in the males and females from each Lepidoptera. Importantly, mutagenesis of Bm-dsx mini-genes and their expression in BmN cell line demonstrated that three RNA elements are involved in the female-specific alternative splicing of Bm-dsx. Mutations in the RNA ciselements 3E-1 and 3E-2 resulted in decreased inclusion of exon 3 into the female-specific dsx mRNA, suggesting that these two elements would be exonic splicing enhancers that facilitate the recognition of the weak 50 splice site at intron 3 of Lepidopteran dsx. We propose that the 50 splice sites at intron 3 are weak, resulting in multiple alternative splicing events in intron 3 of female Lepidoptera dsx. Activation of the 50 splice site requires regulatory cis-elements in exons 3 for female-specific splicing of Lepidoptera dsx.},

@article{wangIdentificationCharacterizationAntimicrobial2021,
	Abstract = {Butterflies represent one of the largest animal groups on Earth, yet antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of this group are less studied in comparison with their moth counterparts. This study employed an integrated bioinformatics approach to survey natural AMPs from publicly available genomic datasets. Numerous AMPs, including cecropins, defensins, and moricins, were identified and subsequently used as templates for the design of a series of synthetic AMPs that mimicked the naturally occurring sequences. Despite differing biological effects among the various sequences, the synthetic AMPs exhibited potent antibacterial and antifungal activities in vitro and in vivo, without inducing hemolysis, which implied their therapeutic potential in infectious diseases. Electron and confocal fluorescence microscopies revealed that the AMPs induced distinct morphological and biophysical changes on microbial cell membranes and nuclei, suggesting that the antimicrobial effects were related to a mechanism of membrane penetration and nucleic acid binding by the peptides. In conclusion, this study not only offers insights into butterfly AMPs but also provides a practical strategy for high-throughput natural AMP discoveries that will have implications for future research in this area.},

Because overexpression of eastcan dramatically alter nuclear architecture we investigated a potential role for EAST in changing chromosome organization during the cell cycle. Following nuclear envelope breakdown, EAST remains enriched in the mitotic remnant of the interphase nucleus until the onset of anaphase. Loss of eastexpression affects the accuracy of division cycles. In female meiosis, east mutations lead to abnormal segregation of nonexchange chromosomes. During the syncytial nuclear cycles, increased frequency of mitotic errors leads to the depletion of surface nuclei. In the post-syncytial cell cycles, abnormal congression of chromosomes in prometaphase delays the onset of anaphase. Loss of east expression also results in abnormal chromosome morphology in male meiosis. We propose that EAST constitutes a component of a nucleoskeleton that helps to constrain the mobility of chromosomes in interphase, mitosis and meiosis.},

@article{weberPhysiologyLongdistanceMigration2009,
	Abstract = {Long-distance migrants have evolved specific adaptations that make their athletic records possible. Unique mechanisms explaining their amazing capacity for endurance exercise have now been uncovered, particularly with respect to energy storage, mobilization, transport and utilization. Birds are champions of migration because flying offers a key compromise: it allows more rapid movement than swimming, but has a lower cost of transport than running. High efficiency for muscle contraction, pointed wings, low wingloading, travelling in V-formations, storing fuel as energy-dense lipids and atrophy of non-essential organs are some of their strategies to decrease the cost of transport. The ability to process lipids rapidly also emerges as a crucial component of the migrant phenotype. High lipid fluxes are made possible by lipoprotein shuttles and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) that accelerate lipid transport and by upgrading the metabolic machinery for lipolysis and lipid oxidation. Preparation for long flights can include natural doping on n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) from unique invertebrate diets. Muscle performance is improved by restructuring membrane phospholipids and by activating key genes of lipid metabolism through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The physiological secret to long migrations does not depend on a single `magic' adaptation but on the integration of multiple adjustments in morphology, biomechanics, behavior,nutrition and metabolism. Research on the physiology of migrants improves the fundamental knowledge of exercise biology, but it also has important implications for wildlife conservation, treating obesity and improving the performance of human athletes.},

	Abstract = {The ability of insects to utilize different host plants has been suggested to be a dynamic and transient phase. During or after this phase, species can shift to novel host plants or respecialize on ancestral ones. Expanding the range of host plants might also be a factor leading to higher levels of net speciation rates. In this paper, we have studied the possible importance of host plant range for diversification in the genus Polygonia (Nymphalidae, Nymphalini). We have compared species richness between sistergroups in order to find out if there are any differences in number of species between clades including species that utilize only the ancestral host plants (`urticalean rosids') and their sisterclades with a broader (or in some cases potentially broader) host plant repertoire. Four comparisons could be made, and although these are not all phylogenetically or statistically independent, all showed clades including butterfly species using other or additional host plants than the urticalean rosids to be more species-rich than their sisterclade restricted to the ancestral host plants. These results are consistent with the theory that expansions in host plant range are involved in the process of diversification in butterflies and other phytophagous insects, in line with the general theory that plasticity may drive speciation.},

Here we review the defining features of each major group of eukaryotic TEs and explore their evolutionary origins and relationships. We discuss how the unique biology of different TEs influences their propagation and distribution within and across genomes. Environmental and genetic factors acting at the level of the host species further modulate the activity, diversification, and fate of TEs, producing the dramatic variation in TE content observed across eukaryotes. We argue that cataloging TE diversity and dissecting the idiosyncratic behavior of individual elements are crucial to expanding our comprehension of their impact on the biology of genomes and the evolution of species.},

@book{wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2009,
	Abstract = {This book describes ggplot2, a new data visualization package for R that uses the insights from Leland Wilkison's Grammar of Graphics to create a powerful and flexible system for creating data graphics. With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specification superpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scales add customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regression save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plots approach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. Hadley Wickham is an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University, and is interested in developing computational and cognitive tools for making data preparation, visualization, and analysis easier. He has developed 15 R packages and in 2006 he won the John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing for his work on the ggplot and reshape R packages.},

	Abstract = {H(+) V-ATPases (V-ATPases) are found in two principal locations, in endomembranes and in plasma membranes. The plasma membrane V-ATPase from the midgut of larval Manduca sexta is the sole energizer of all transepithelial secondary transport processes. At least two properties make the lepidopteran midgut a model tissue for studies of general aspects of V-ATPases. First, it is a rich source for purification of the enzyme and therefore for structural studies: 20 larvae provide up to 0.5 mg of holoenzyme, and soluble, cytosolic V(1) complexes can be obtained in even greater amounts of up to 2 mg. Second, midgut ion-tranport processes are strictly controlled by the regulation of the V-ATPase, which is the sole energizer of all ion transport in this epithelium. Recent advances in our understanding the structure of the V(1) and V(o) complexes and of the regulation of the enzyme's biosynthesis and ion-transport activity will be discussed.},

	Abstract = {Active transepithelial cation transport in insects was initially discovered  in Malpighian tubules, and was subsequently also found in other epithelia such  as salivary glands, labial glands, midgut and sensory sensilla. Today it  appears to be established that the cation pump is a two-component system of a  H+-transporting V-ATPase and a cation/nH+ antiporter.  After tracing the discovery of the V-ATPase as the energizer of  K+/nH+ antiport in the larval midgut of the tobacco  hornworm Manduca sexta we show that research on the tobacco hornworm  V-ATPase delivered important findings that emerged to be of general  significance for our knowledge of V-ATPases, which are ubiquitous and highly  conserved proton pumps. We then discuss the V-ATPase in Malpighian tubules of  the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster where the potential of  post-genomic biology has been impressively illustrated. Finally we review an  integrated physiological approach in Malpighian tubules of the yellow fever  mosquito Aedes aegypti which shows that the V-ATPase delivers the  energy for both transcellular and paracellular ion transport.},

@article{wittkoppCisregulatoryElementsMolecular2012,
	Abstract = {Cis-regulatory sequences, such as enhancers and promoters, control development and physiology by regulating gene expression. Mutations that affect the function of these sequences contribute to phenotypic diversity within and between species. With many case studies implicating divergent cis-regulatory activity in phenotypic evolution, researchers have recently begun to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for cis-regulatory divergence. Approaches include detailed functional analysis of individual cis-regulatory elements and comparing mechanisms of gene regulation among species using the latest genomic tools. Despite the limited number of mechanistic studies published to date, this work shows how cis-regulatory activity can diverge and how studies of cis-regulatory divergence can address long-standing questions about the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic evolution.},

	Abstract = {Abstract                            Background               With the abundance of information and analysis results being collected for genetic loci, user-friendly and flexible data visualization approaches can inform and improve the analysis and dissemination of these data. A chromosomal ideogram is an idealized graphic representation of chromosomes. Ideograms can be combined with overlaid points, lines, and/or shapes, to provide summary information from studies of various kinds, such as genome-wide association studies or phenome-wide association studies, coupled with genomic location information. To facilitate visualizing varied data in multiple ways using ideograms, we have developed a flexible software tool called PhenoGram which exists as a web-based tool and also a command-line program.                                         Results               With PhenoGram researchers can create chomosomal ideograms annotated with lines in color at specific base-pair locations, or colored base-pair to base-pair regions, with or without other annotation. PhenoGram allows for annotation of chromosomal locations and/or regions with shapes in different colors, gene identifiers, or other text. PhenoGram also allows for creation of plots showing expanded chromosomal locations, providing a way to show results for specific chromosomal regions in greater detail. We have now used PhenoGram to produce a variety of different plots, and provide these as examples herein. These plots include visualization of the genomic coverage of SNPs from a genotyping array, highlighting the chromosomal coverage of imputed SNPs, copy-number variation region coverage, as well as plots similar to the NHGRI GWA Catalog of genome-wide association results.                                         Conclusions               PhenoGram is a versatile, user-friendly software tool fostering the exploration and sharing of genomic information. Through visualization of data, researchers can both explore and share complex results, facilitating a greater understanding of these data.},

@article{xiaMetagenomicSequencingDiamondback2017,
	Abstract = {Herbivore specialists adapt to feed on a specific group of host plants by evolving various mechanisms to respond to plant defenses. Insects also possess complex gut microbiotas but their potential role in adaptation is poorly understood. Our previous study of the genome of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, revealed an intrinsic capacity to detoxify plant defense compounds, which is an important factor in its success as a pest. Here we expand on that work with a complete taxonomic and functional profile of the P. xylostella gut microbiota obtained by metagenomic sequencing. Gene enrichment in the metagenome, accompanied by functional identification, revealed an important role of specific gut bacteria in the breakdown of plant cell walls, detoxification of plant phenolics, and synthesis of amino acids. Microbes participating in these pathways mainly belonged to three highly abundant bacteria: Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter asburiae, and Carnobacterium maltaromaticum. Results show that while the gut microbial community may be complex, a small number of functionally active species can be disproportionally important. The presence of specific enzymes in the microbiota community, such as supporting amino acid synthesis, digestion and detoxification functions, demonstrates the beneficial interactions between P. xylostella and its gut microbiota. These interactions can be potential targets for manipulation to provide novel pest management approaches.},

We generated a chromosome-level genome assembly containing 576.94\,Mb using Nanopore long reads (approximately 130×) and Hi-C data (approximately 134×). The final assembly contained 804 scaffolds, with an N50 length of 19.00\,Mb, and 94.96\% (547.89\,Mb) of the assembly was anchored into 31 pseudochromosomes. We masked 58.12\% (335.32\,Mb) of the genome as repetitive elements, identified 727 noncoding RNAs, and predicted 15,637 protein-coding genes. Gene family evolution and functional enrichment analyses revealed significantly expanded gene families primarily involved in digestion, detoxification, and chemosensation. Strong chromosomal syntenic relationships were also observed among E. elutella, silkworm, and tobacco cutworm. This study could provide a valuable genomic basis for better understanding the biology of E. elutella.},

	Abstract = {The leaf resemblance of Kallima (Nymphalidae) butterflies is an important ecological adaptive mechanism that increases their survival. However, the genetic mechanism underlying ecological adaptation remains unclear owing to a dearth of genomic information. Here, we determined the karyotype (n = 31) of the dead-leaf butterfly Kallima inachus, and generated a high-quality, chromosome-level assembly (568.92 Mb; contig N50: 19.20 Mb). We also identified candidate Z and W chromosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on these aspects of this species. In the assembled genome, 15,309 protein-coding genes and 49.86\% repeat elements were annotated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that K. inachus diverged from Melitaea cinxia (no leaf resemblance), both of which are in Nymphalinae, around 40 million years ago. Demographic analysis indicated that the effective population size of K. inachus decreased during the last interglacial period in the Pleistocene. The wings of adults with the pigmentary gene ebony knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 showed phenotypes in which the orange dorsal region and entire ventral surface darkened, suggesting its vital role in the ecological adaption of dead-leaf butterflies. Our results provide important genome resources for investigating the genetic mechanism underlying protective resemblance in dead-leaf butterflies and insights into the molecular basis of protective coloration.},

In addition, eight known genes and five visible mutations were mapped. Bombyx homologues of engrailed and invected genes were found to be closely linked, as in Drosophila melanogaster. The average interval between markers was ∼2 cM, equal to ∼500 kb. The correspondence of seven linkage groups to counterparts of the conventional linkage map was determined.

@article{yasukochiExtensiveConservedSynteny2009,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome sequencing projects have been completed for several species representing four highly diverged holometabolous insect orders, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. The striking evolutionary diversity of insects argues a need for efficient methods to apply genome information from such models to genetically uncharacterized species. Constructing conserved synteny maps plays a crucial role in this task. Here, we demonstrate the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization with bacterial artificial chromosome probes as a powerful tool for physical mapping of genes and comparative genome analysis in Lepidoptera, which have numerous and morphologically uniform holokinetic chromosomes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We isolated 214 clones containing 159 orthologs of well conserved single-copy genes of a sequenced lepidopteran model, the silkworm, Bombyx mori, from a BAC library of a sphingid with an unexplored genome, the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. We then constructed a BAC-FISH karyotype identifying all 28 chromosomes of M. sexta by mapping 124 loci using the corresponding BAC clones. BAC probes from three M. sexta chromosomes also generated clear signals on the corresponding chromosomes of the convolvulus hawk moth, Agrius convolvuli, which belongs to the same subfamily, Sphinginae, as M. sexta. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Comparison of the M. sexta BAC physical map with the linkage map and genome sequence of B. mori pointed to extensive conserved synteny including conserved gene order in most chromosomes. Only a few rearrangements, including three inversions, three translocations, and two fission/fusion events were estimated to have occurred after the divergence of Bombycidae and Sphingidae. These results add to accumulating evidence for the stability of lepidopteran genomes. Generating signals on A. convolvuli chromosomes using heterologous M. sexta probes demonstrated that BAC-FISH with orthologous sequences can be used for karyotyping a wide range of related and genetically uncharacterized species, significantly extending the ability to develop synteny maps for comparative and functional genomics.},

@article{yoshidoEvolutionMultipleSexchromosomes2020,
	Abstract = {Sex-chromosome systems tend to be highly conserved and knowledge about their evolution typically comes from macroevolutionary inference. Rapidly evolving complex sex-chromosome systems represent a rare opportunity to study the mechanisms of sex-chromosome evolution at unprecedented resolution. Three cryptic species of wood-white butterflies---Leptidea juvernica, L. sinapis and L. reali---have each a unique set of multiple sex-chromosomes with 3--4 W and 3--4 Z chromosomes. Using a transcriptome-based microarray for comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) and a library of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, both developed in L. juvernica, we identified Z-linked Leptidea orthologs of Bombyx mori genes and mapped them by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with BAC probes on multiple Z chromosomes. In all three species, we determined synteny blocks of autosomal origin and reconstructed the evolution of multiple sex-chromosomes. In addition, we identified W homologues of Z-linked orthologs and characterised their molecular differentiation. Our results suggest that the multiple sex-chromosome system evolved in a common ancestor as a result of dynamic genome reshuffling through repeated rearrangements between the sex chromosomes and autosomes, including translocations, fusions and fissions. Thus, the initial formation of neo-sex chromosomes could not have played a role in reproductive isolation between these Leptidea species. However, the subsequent species-specific fissions of several neo-sex chromosomes could have contributed to their reproductive isolation. Then, significantly increased numbers of Z-linked genes and independent neo-W chromosome degeneration could accelerate the accumulation of genetic incompatibilities between populations and promote their divergence resulting in speciation.},

@article{yunLevelsRNAFamily1989,
	Abstract = {We have isolated several genes expressed at abnormal levels in the memory mutant, dunce (dnc), of Drosophila melanogaster. These mutants have an elevated cyclic AMP (cAMP) content due to a mutation in the structural gene for cAMP phosphodiesterase, so the isolated genes are potentially ones regulated by cAMP. Here, we describe the characterization of a genomic clone and corresponding cDNA clones which contain sequences that are underexpressed in dnc mutants. Sequence analysis of portions of the genomic clone and representative cDNAs revealed the presence of two uninterrupted and complete open reading frames (SER1 and SER2) and part of a third (SER3). The predicted amino acid sequences of all of these were found to be homologous to the serine protease family of enzymes. The genomic clone was localized to the polytene chromosome region 99C-D, although genome-blotting experiments indicated the existence of several other genes related to the cloned serine protease-like genes. Hybridization experiments with probes representing each of the three sequenced genes showed that only the SER1-related genes were differentially expressed in dnc mutants. The putative serine protease genes were abundantly expressed in the larval gut, suggesting a major function in digestion. Feeding normal flies cAMP, isobutylmethylxanthine, or forskolin resulted in a decreased RNA level of the SER1-related genes. Thus, RNA levels of this serine protease gene family are negatively regulated by cAMP.},

	Abstract = {The monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, is famous for its spectacular annual migration across North America, recent worldwide dispersal, and orange warning colouration. Despite decades of study and broad public interest, we know little about the genetic basis of these hallmark traits. Here we uncover the history of the monarch's evolutionary origin and global dispersal, characterize the genes and pathways associated with migratory behaviour, and identify the discrete genetic basis of warning colouration by sequencing 101 Danaus genomes from around the globe. The results rewrite our understanding of this classic system, showing that D. plexippus was ancestrally migratory and dispersed out of North America to occupy its broad distribution. We find the strongest signatures of selection associated with migration centre on flight muscle function, resulting in greater flight efficiency among migratory monarchs, and that variation in monarch warning colouration is controlled by a single myosin gene not previously implicated in insect pigmentation.},

@article{zhangGenomicsCompleteButterfly2019,
	Abstract = {Never before have we had the luxury of choosing a continent, picking a large phylogenetic group of animals, and obtaining genomic data for its every species. Here, we sequence all 845 species of butterflies recorded from North America north of Mexico. Our comprehensive approach reveals the pattern of diversification and adaptation occurring in this phylogenetic lineage as it has spread over the continent, which cannot be seen on a sample of selected species. We observe bursts of diversification that generated taxonomic ranks: subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, and species. The older burst around 70 Mya resulted in the butterfly subfamilies, with the major evolutionary inventions being unique phenotypic traits shaped by high positive selection and gene duplications. The recent burst around 5 Mya is caused by explosive radiation in diverse butterfly groups associated with diversification in transcription and mRNA regulation, morphogenesis, and mate selection. Rapid radiation correlates with more frequent introgression of speciation-promoting and beneficial genes among radiating species. Radiation and extinction patterns over the last 100 million years suggest the following general model of animal evolution. A population spreads over the land, adapts to various conditions through mutations, and diversifies into several species. Occasional hybridization between these species results in accumulation of beneficial alleles in one, which eventually survives, while others become extinct. Not only butterflies, but also the hominids may have followed this path.},

	Abstract = {The painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, has the longest migration routes, the widest hostplant diversity, and one of the most complex wing patterns of any insect. Due to minimal culturing requirements, easily characterized wing pattern elements, and technical feasibility of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, V. cardui is emerging as a functional genomics model for diverse research programs. Here, we report a high-quality, annotated genome assembly of the V. cardui genome, generated using 84× coverage of PacBio long-read data, which we assembled into 205 contigs with a total length of 425.4\,Mb (N50\,=\,10.3\,Mb). The genome was very complete (single-copy complete Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs [BUSCO] 97\%), with contigs assembled into presumptive chromosomes using synteny analyses. Our annotation used embryonic, larval, and pupal transcriptomes, and 20 transcriptomes across five different wing developmental stages. Gene annotations showed a high level of accuracy and completeness, with 14,437 predicted protein-coding genes. This annotated genome assembly constitutes an important resource for diverse functional genomic studies ranging from the developmental genetic basis of butterfly color pattern, to coevolution with diverse hostplants.},

Codon optimality has been shown to regulate translation elongation speed in fungal systems, but its effect on translation elongation speed in animal systems is not clear. In this study, we used a Drosophila cell-free translation system to directly compare the velocity of mRNA translation elongation. Our results demonstrate that optimal synonymous codons speed up translation elongation while non-optimal codons slow down translation. In addition, codon usage regulates ribosome movement and stalling on mRNA during translation. Finally, we show that codon usage affects protein structure and function in vitro and in Drosophila cells. Together, these results suggest that the effect of codon usage on translation elongation speed is a conserved mechanism from fungi to animals that can affect protein folding in eukaryotic organisms.},

@incollection{zhenMethodsDetectSelection2012,
	Abstract = {Vast tracts of noncoding DNA contain elements that regulate gene expression in higher eukaryotes. Describing these regulatory elements and understanding how they evolve represent major challenges for biologists. Advances in the ability to survey genome-scale DNA sequence data are providing unprecedented opportunities to use evolutionary models and computational tools to identify functionally important elements and the mode of selection acting on them in multiple species. This chapter reviews some of the current methods that have been developed and applied on noncoding DNA, what they have shown us, and how they are limited. Results of several recent studies reveal that a significantly larger fraction of noncoding DNA in eukaryotic organisms is likely to be functional than previously believed, implying that the functional annotation of most noncoding DNA in these organisms is largely incomplete. In Drosophila, recent studies have further suggested that a large fraction of noncoding DNA divergence observed between species may be the product of recurrent adaptive substitution. Similar studies in humans have revealed a more complex pattern, with signatures of recurrent positive selection being largely concentrated in conserved noncoding DNA elements. Understanding these patterns and the extent to which they generalize to other organisms awaits the analysis of forthcoming genome-scale polymorphism and divergence data from more species.},

@article{zhouCodonUsageImportant2016,
	Abstract = {Codon usage biases are found in all eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and preferred codons are more frequently used in highly expressed genes. The effects of codon usage on gene expression were previously thought to be mainly mediated by its impacts on translation. Here, we show that codon usage strongly correlates with both protein and mRNA levels genome-wide in the filamentous fungus               Neurospora               . Gene codon optimization also results in strong up-regulation of protein and RNA levels, suggesting that codon usage is an important determinant of gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that the impact of codon usage on gene expression results mainly from effects on transcription and is largely independent of mRNA translation and mRNA stability. Furthermore, we show that histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation is one of the mechanisms responsible for the codon usage-mediated transcriptional silencing of some genes with nonoptimal codons. Together, these results uncovered an unexpected important role of codon usage in ORF sequences in determining transcription levels and suggest that codon biases are an adaptation of protein coding sequences to both transcription and translation machineries. Therefore, synonymous codons not only specify protein sequences and translation dynamics, but also help determine gene expression levels.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Gut microbes can enhance the ability of hosts to consume secondary plant compounds and, therefore, expand the dietary niche breadth of mammalian herbivores. The giant and red pandas are bamboo-eating specialists within the mammalian order Carnivora. Bamboo contains abundant plant secondary metabolites (e.g., cyanide-containing compounds). However, Carnivora species, including the giant panda, have deficient levels of rhodanese (one of the essential cyanide detoxification enzymes) in their tissues compared with the same tissues of herbivores. Here, we make a comparative analysis of 94 gut metagenomes, including 25 from bamboo-eating pandas (19 from giant pandas and 6 from red pandas), 30 from P{\`e}re David's deer, and 39 from published data for other mammals. The bamboo-eating pandas' gut microbiomes had some common features, such as high proportions of               Pseudomonas               bacteria. The results revealed that bamboo-eating pandas' gut microbiomes were significantly enriched in putative genes coding for enzymes related to cyanide degradation (e.g., rhodanese) compared with the gut microbiomes of typical herbivorous mammals, which might have coevolved with their special bamboo diets. The enrichment of putative cyanide-digesting gut microbes, in combination with adaptations related to morphology (e.g., pseudothumbs) and genomic signatures, show that the giant panda and red panda have evolved some common traits to adapt to their bamboo diet.                                         IMPORTANCE               The giant panda (               Ailuropoda melanoleuca               ) and red panda (               Ailurus fulgens               ), two obligate bamboo feeders, have distinct phylogenetic positions in the order Carnivora. Bamboo is extraordinarily rich in plant secondary metabolites, such as allied phenolic and polyphenolic compounds and even toxic cyanide compounds. Here, the enrichment of putative cyanide-digesting gut microbes, in combination with adaptations related to morphology (e.g., pseudothumbs) and genomic signatures, show that the giant panda and red panda have evolved some common traits to adapt to their bamboo diet. Thus, here is another story of diet-driven gut microbiota in nature.},
