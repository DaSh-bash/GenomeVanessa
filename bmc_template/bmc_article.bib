	Abstract = {{Conservation genomics has made dramatic improvements over the past decade, leveraging the power of genomes to infer diverse parameters central to conservation management questions. However, much of this effort has focused upon vertebrate species, despite insects providing similar flagship status with the added benefit of smaller genomes, shorter generation times and extensive historical collections in museums. Here we present the genome of the Apollo butterfly (Parnassius apollo, Papilionidae), an iconic endangered butterfly, which like many species in this genus, needs conservation genomic attention yet lacks a genome. Using 68.7 Gb of long-read data (N50 = 15.2 kb) we assembled a 1.4 Gb genome for the Apollo butterfly, making this the largest sequenced Lepidopteran genome to date. The assembly was highly contiguous (N50 = 7.1 Mb) and complete (97\\% of Lepidopteran BUSCOs were single-copy and complete) and consisted of 1,707 contigs. Using RNAseq data and Arthropoda proteins, we annotated 28.3K genes. Alignment with the closest-related chromosome-level assembly, Papilio bianor, reveals a highly conserved chromosomal organization, albeit genome size is highly expanded in the Apollo butterfly, due primarily to a dramatic increase in repetitive element content. Using this alignment for superscaffolding places the P. apollo genome in to 31 chromosomal scaffolds, and together with our functional annotation, provides an essential resource for advancing conservation genomics in a flagship species for insect conservation.}},

	Abstract = {Characterizing and quantifying genome size variation among organisms and understanding if genome size evolves as a consequence of adaptive or stochastic processes have been long-standing goals in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigate genome size variation and association with transposable elements (TEs) across lepidopteran lineages using a novel genome assembly of the common wood-white (Leptidea sinapis) and population re-sequencing data from both L. sinapis and the closely related L. reali and L. juvernica together with 12 previously available lepidopteran genome assemblies. A phylogenetic analysis confirms established relationships among species, but identifies previously unknown intraspecific structure within Leptidea lineages. The genome assembly of L. sinapis is one of the largest of any lepidopteran taxon so far (643 Mb) and genome size is correlated with abundance of TEs, both in Lepidoptera in general and within Leptidea where L. juvernica from Kazakhstan has considerably larger genome size than any other Leptidea population. Specific TE subclasses have been active in different Lepidoptera lineages with a pronounced expansion of predominantly LINEs, DNA elements, and unclassified TEs in the Leptidea lineage after the split from other Pieridae. The rate of genome expansion in Leptidea in general has been in the range of four Mb/Million year (My), with an increase in a particular L. juvernica population to 72 Mb/My. The considerable differences in accumulation rates of specific TE classes in different lineages indicate that TE activity plays a major role in genome size evolution in butterflies and moths.},

@article{Talla2019Dissecting,
	Abstract = {{The relative role of natural selection and genetic drift in evolution is a major topic of debate in evolutionary biology. Most knowledge spring from a small group of organisms and originate from before it was possible to generate genome-wide data on genetic variation. Hence, it is necessary to extend to a larger number of taxonomic groups, descriptive and hypothesis-based research aiming at understanding the proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying both levels of genetic polymorphism and the efficiency of natural selection. In this study, we used data from 60 whole-genome resequenced individuals of three cryptic butterfly species (Leptidea sp.), together with novel gene annotation information and population recombination data. We characterized the overall prevalence of natural selection and investigated the effects of mutation and linked selection on regional variation in nucleotide diversity. Our analyses showed that genome-wide diversity and rate of adaptive substitutions were comparatively low, whereas nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism and substitution levels were comparatively high in Leptidea, suggesting small long-term effective population sizes. Still, negative selection on linked sites (background selection) has resulted in reduced nucleotide diversity in regions with relatively high gene density and low recombination rate. We also found a significant effect of mutation rate variation on levels of polymorphism. Finally, there were considerable population differences in levels of genetic diversity and pervasiveness of selection against slightly deleterious alleles, in line with expectations from differences in estimated effective population sizes.}},

@article{Chen2013NewGenes,
	Abstract = {The study of phenotypic evolution is of central importance for understanding the evolution of biological diversity.The contribution of new genes to the genetic circuitry underlying the phenotypic evolution of various species, particularly mammals and Drosophila spp., has attracted considerable research interest.An important theme to emerge is that many new genes have evolved indispensable roles in fundamental biological processes, including development, reproduction, brain function and behaviour.The process of gene evolution is so rapid that the examined species have already added species-specific or lineage-specific essential genes to the genetic systems that govern these biological processes.The molecular explanations for how new genes integrate into existing networks and become essential components are currently under investigation.These observations revealed previously unexpected genetic diversity that drove the evolution of phenotypes, and they raised new interesting problems to tackle in the field of genetics and evolution.},

	Abstract = {The importance of gene duplication in supplying raw genetic material to biological evolution has been recognized since the 1930s. Recent genomic sequence data provide substantial evidence for the abundance of duplicated genes in all organisms surveyed. But how do newly duplicated genes survive and acquire novel functions, and what role does gene duplication play in the evolution of genomes and organisms? Detailed molecular characterization of individual gene families, computational analysis of genomic sequences and population genetic modeling can all be used to help us uncover the mechanisms behind the evolution by gene duplication.},
