## Manual curation of Hi-C maps

**Scaffold 1:**  
Small scaffolds moved to debris  
The rest to be joined with scaffold 2  

**Scaffold 2:**  
small part of the Scaffold 274 (tig00000512) seems out of place - not corrected   

**Scaffold 3:**  
tig00000407 flipped  
tig00000110 broke apart, fragments of debris removed  
real tandem repeat in the same tig - may be explored
tig00000258 may need editing  

**Scaffold 4:**
check chromosomal structure  

**Scaffold 5:**
moved to beginning scaffolds/haplotigs to debris  
and final small scaffold too

**Scaffold 6:**  
Check end of chromosome  

**Scaffold 7:**   
no problems  

**Scaffold 8:**  
no problems

**Scaffold 9:**
multiple loop structure

**Scaffold 10:**  
no problems
